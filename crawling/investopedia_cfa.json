By not simply meeting minimum legal requirements, the CFA Institute and its members aim to increase public confidence and acceptance of the investment profession. Although today's exam tests competence in many areas (including accounting, economics, quantitative methods, asset valuation, portfolio management and more), the core intent of the CFA Program and the CFA Institute is to promote the highest ethical standards among investment professionals.\n\r\nAlthough only 15% of the exam focuses on ethics, this is single-handedly the most important topic on your upcoming exam. If your average score on other topics is close to the minimum passing score, your score on ethics-related questions is essential in determining whether you pass or fail.\n\r\nThe Code and Standards is designed to be relevant and constant over time; however, the CFA Institute periodically updates its principles to stay current with significant developments in investment management. The global financial crisis of 2008 triggered such a review. A new section entitled \"Why Ethics Matters\" was added to the 10th edition, which highlights that investment professionals need to be aware of how their actions impact the global economy and marketplace. Additionally, given the worldwide and diverse nature of today's CFA Institute membership, the language and examples in the Handbook were clarified and simplified to improve understanding for all. \n\n\n\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_1", "text": "\nStandards of Practice Handbook\nThe Standards of Practice Handbook was first published in 1982. The 10thP edition, released in 2010, contains a number of changes to the Code and Standards, which make the handbook easier to understand. Standard III (A) Duties to Clients \u2013Loyalty, Prudence and Care was shortened and clarified. A new chapter was added, which discusses ethics in investment management in the wake of the recent turmoil in the capital markets. Bulleted tables were added to the handbook to help investment professionals locate guidance and standards quickly when faced with real-life ethical dilemmas. The 10th edition also makes it easier for the reader to find examples of situations they may encounter and cross-references the various standards that may come into play in a single situation.\nThe CFA Institute has published their entire Standards of Practice Handbook, 10th Edition as of PDF online for free. We strongly recommend savings and/or printing the handbook as a source of study for your exam as it contains examples that are quite similar to the types of questions that will appear on your exam.\nOrganization of this Section\nEach Standard is used as the heading for a section that covers that Standard in detail and presents examples that will help make the intent of each Standard clearer. Some Standards are very clear and straightforward; other Standards are quite complicated and open to interpretation. Certain Standards that we believe are more likely to be emphasized on the exam are highlighted so candidates can focus additional attention on them while studying.\nA: Why Ethics Matter\nThe addition of the chapter, \"Why Ethics Matter,\" is a major change to the handbook. Resulting from the financial crisis of 2008, this section addresses the importance of understanding the long-term impact of investment decisions on market integrity and sustainability. Recent events have revealed unethical behavior not just within investment firms, but also rating agencies, corporate boards, accounting firms, financial technology products and more. The chapter emphasizes the interconnected, global nature of finance today.\nKey points from this section include the following:\n1. Top managers must create a strong culture of ethics at their firms, which must filter throughout their entire organization, not just among CFA charter holders or CFA candidates. \n2. The integrated and global nature of finance today gives rise to concerns over market sustainability. Investment professionals must consider that the sum of their individual decisions may precipitate a market crisis in ways unimagined years ago. Minor, relatively insignificant decisions can compound into a major crisis that can jeopardize the proper functioning of the capital markets.\n3.  Regulation alone can't prevent the ethical lapses that create financial crises. What's required are strong ethical principles, adopted by individuals and firms beyond those associated with the CFA Institute. Regulators and others are encouraged to adopt the Handbook's guidance to promote ethical behavior.\n4.  The CFA Institute is committed to providing educational resources to members, candidates and the investment community at large in order to assist in holding true to the Code and Standards. Podcasts, reading material, presentations and the like can be found at www.cfainstitute.org\nCapital markets operate on trust. The recent financial crisis showed how unstable markets can be when trust is violated. Investment professionals must now integrate a concern for the long-term health and sustainability of the global capital markets when making their individual investment decisions. \nB: Code of Ethics\nThe Six Components to the Code of Ethics\nMembers of the CFA Institute (including Chartered Financial Analyst [CFA] charterholders) and candidates for the CFA designation (\"Members and Candidates\") must:\n\u00a0\nAct with integrity, competence, diligence, respect, and in an ethical manner with the public, clients, prospective clients, employers, employees, colleagues in the investment profession, and other participants in the global capital markets.\n\nPlace the integrity of the investment profession and the interests of clients above their own personal interests.\n\nUse reasonable care and exercise independent professional judgment when conducting investment analysis, making investment recommendations, taking investment actions, and engaging in other professional activities.\n\nPractice and encourage others to practice in a professional and ethical manner that will reflect credit on themselves and the profession.\n\nPromote the integrity of, and uphold the rules governing, capital markets.\nMaintain and improve their professional competence and strive to maintain and improve the competence of other investment professionals.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nLook Out!Remember: the handbook emphasizes that members should discuss the content of the Code and Standards with their superiors, legal and compliance departments\n\t\t\t\u00a0\n\nReasoning Behind the Code of Ethics\nThe Code of Ethics lays out a series of guidelines that serves as the basis for creating the more specific Standards of Professional Conduct. The Code of Ethics is analogous to a company's mission statement, or the preamble to the Constitution. The 149 words comprising the Code are intended to be broad, sweeping and general and to reflect what CFA charterholders believe defines them.\nThe CFA examination will likely devote a couple of questions to testing whether a candidate has taken the time to memorize these six components. Therefore, ensure you memorize all six components!\nHere is an easy way to glue these concepts to your memory: PEJMAR\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPriority - Your client's interests always come first.\nEncourage - Practice and encourage others to act professionally and ethically to reflect credit on yourself and the profession.\nJudgment - use reasonable care and judgment when performing all professional activities.\nMaintain - keep your knowledge up to date and encourage other professionals to do the same.\nActions - employ integrity, competence, diligence, and respect in an ethical manner with everyone.\nRules - promote the integrity of capital markets by following the rules.\n\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_2", "text": "\n        From the CFA Institute's Code of Ethics and Standards of Professional Conduct, candidates are expected to know what is required by the Code and Standards with respect to:\n\r\nI. Professionalism\r\nII. Integrity of Capital Markets\r\nIII. Duties to Clients and Prospective Clients\r\nIV. Duties to Employers\r\nV. Investment Analysis, Recommendations, and Action\r\nVI. Conflicts of Interest\r\nVII. Responsibilities as a CFA Institute Member or CFA Candidate\n\nReasoning behind Standards I through VII\r\nThe Standards of Professional Conduct are a series of guidelines, more specific than the Code of Ethics, intended to focus on a wide variety of issues relating to the investment profession. As the industry evolves, additional Standards are added. For example, the Standards that took effect in 2006 have seven categories rather than five, with the new categories reflecting the complexity of the business as it is today, as opposed to what it was in the 1990s when the most recent revision was enacted. At the same time, the world is evolving faster than the Standards can evolve. Not all situations can be covered in specific detail by the Standards of Professional Conduct.\n\n\r\n\t\tStandard I aims to set out a minimum level of conduct to guide CFA members and candidates in all business situations and is intended to be broad in scope.\n\r\n\t\tStandards II through VII are more focused and address specific topics that are critical to the integrity of the investment business.\n\r\nStandard I, Professionalism, makes it clear that high ethical standards must apply even when an issue hasn't been identified in writing and addressed as an individual Standard, establishing an ethical culture among CFA charterholders and those who aspire to become CFA charterholders.\n        \n        \n            \n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_3", "text": "\n        Standard I consists of four subsections:\r\n- I-A: Knowledge of the Law\r\n- I-B: Independence and Objectivity\r\n- I-C: Misrepresentation\r\n- I-D: Misconduct\n\nStandard I-A: Knowledge of the Law\r\nMembers and Candidates must understand and comply with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations (including the CFA Institute Code of Ethics and Standards of Professional Conduct) of any government, regulatory organization, licensing agency, or professional association governing their professional activities. In the event of conflict, Members and Candidates must not knowingly participate or assist in and must disassociate from any violation of such laws, rules, or regulations.\n\nObey the Law!\r\nIt seems like common sense. However, when applied to international situations, in which laws in some jurisdictions are stricter than in others, standards of conduct can be unclear. Let's say an analyst resides in a country where securities laws are less strict and conducts business in a country where the laws are stricter. Now assume the analyst is a CFA charterholder, meaning he or she is bound by the Code and Standards. Which laws and standards apply? The CFA Institute Standards of Conduct recognize that the typical CFA charterholder or candidate is not going to be an attorney with specific knowledge and expertise on which laws apply to which situation. To provide guidance in these ambiguous situations, Standard I-A contains a rule of thumb for members operating in multiple jurisdictions:\n\n\n\n\nRule of Thumb: When applicable law is stricter than the Code and Standards, members and candidates must adhere to applicable law. If conduct is governed by local laws that are less strict than the Standards, members and candidates must adhere to the Code and Standards.\n\n\n\n\nApplying Standard I-A\r\nSince Standard I-A covers laws, rules and regulations, the situations presented to test knowledge of the Standard (and whether the Standard has been violated) will likely involve some possible violation of the law, and how a CFA Member or Candidate should proceed. The following questions may apply:\n\n\nDid the Member seek the advice of counsel?\r\n\t\tConsulting an attorney is typically seen as a good defense against an alleged violation of Standard I-A. Many cases involve someone who works for a firm that has violated the law (made misleading statements on a prospectus, for example). In these cases, look to see if the CFA member or candidate sought and followed the advice of counsel.\n\n\nDid the member report the violation, and to whom did the member report it?\r\n\t\tFor any potential violation of a law, rule or regulation, if the situation suggests that the member either went along with it, did nothing, tried to cover it up or was afraid to say anything for fear of losing his or her job that is a clear sign that the Standard has been violated. In any example, look for evidence that the CFA member tried to do the right thing. If that person's firm is potentially guilty of violating a law or regulation, he or she needs to start by reporting this situation to his or her supervisor and/or compliance officer. If the situation is not remedied, he or she should distance him or herself from the potential violation and seek the advice of counsel.\n\n\nFor multinational operations, which country's laws apply to the situation at hand?\r\n\t\tIn the real world, it can be ambiguous if an advisor is domiciled in one country and operates in another. For the purposes of the CFA Level I exam, the candidate isn't expected to be a lawyer and make a judgment - the exam will indicate which country's laws apply to the situation. If a broker or advisor operates solely or exclusively in a country, assume that those laws apply unless it's stated otherwise. The rule of thumb (which states it's the law that applies if it's stricter than the Standards; otherwise, the Standards apply) is usually going to make it easy to arrive at the right answer.\n\n\nHow to Comply with Standard I-A\r\nThe Standards of Practice Handbook makes a number of suggestions to avoid violating Standard I-A.\n\n\n\nEstablish Files - These files would cover all applicable laws, rules, regulations, statutes and important cases that might be relevant to any potential business situation involving the firm. Files must be readily accessible, and a process to manage, distribute and interpret such material should be in place.\n\n\nStay Informed - Laws, rules and regulations frequently change, and key employees in a firm must be informed continually of such changes. CFA members and candidates are obligated to establish, or encourage others to establish, a procedure by which everyone in a firm is kept informed and applicable changes are disseminated in a timely manner. Usually, this procedure is the domain of the firm's counsel or compliance department, but every situation is different. There are a number of real-world cases in which everyone just assumed that a certain person or department was taking care of it.\n\n\nDistribution Area Laws - In an increasingly global marketplace, members and candidates must make every effort to understand the laws of the country or region in which they operate, including those where their products or services are distributed across borders. \n\n\nLegal or Illegal? - Certain conduct may not in fact be a violation. Members should consult counsel in ambiguous situations.\n\n\nDisassociate - This is such a good word and a worthwhile course of action that the CFA Institute decided to include it when it recently revised this Standard. It is good advice: it may have been OK at some time in the past to do nothing if one witnessed illegal or unethical conduct, but in today's environment, the Standards have changed. One must now disassociate from any illegal activity and actively urge the firm (either an immediate supervisor or a compliance officer) to cease any conduct that violates the law or an applicable regulation or standard. Inaction might be judged, (even in a court of law), as participating or assisting, which violates the Standard.\n\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_4", "text": "\nMembers and Candidates must use reasonable care and judgment to achieve and maintain independence and objectivity in their professional activities. Members and Candidates must not offer, solicit, or accept any gift, benefit, compensation, or consideration that reasonably could be expected to compromise their own or another's independence and objectivity.\n\nReasoning behind Standard I-B\nThis Standard addresses the integrity of the investment process and revisits the dangers inherent in a conflict of interest.\n\nIn the investment industry, portfolio managers and analysts are subject to temptation in the form of perks and favors such as lavish gifts, additional compensation and bonuses, tickets to sporting events or sold-out shows, luxury hotel and resort accommodations and so on. These favors are provided as a quid pro quo (either explicit or implicit) by which the analyst or manager is pressured into buying a particular security or changing a recommendation to the provider of the money or gifts. These arrangements (those that have been uncovered) have given the money management profession an unsavory reputation, and it is the goal of the CFA Institute to promote higher ethical standards.\n\nPressures from Other Departments\nAnother common practice that violates this Standard, but which seems somewhat less egregious on the surface (as it doesn't explicitly involve money), is the pressure placed on research and investment professionals by sources from other departments within the same company. For example, a large financial services outfit is likely to have an investment research wing, as well as a corporate finance wing that is primarily interested in facilitating relationships with companies for underwriting new issuances of debt or equity (as an example). When the research department is carrying a sell recommendation (or even a hold or anything less than a strong buy) on that company, the underwriting department wants to know why its \"brothers and sisters in arms\" are not doing more to \"help the company's cause\". Such a situation can be stressful and uncomfortable, as everyone feels the sense of duty to employer. \n\nConflicts Between Standard I-B and IV\nAn entire section (all of the ideals under Standard IV) of the Standards of Professional Conduct is devoted to the responsibilities we owe to our employer. However, Standard I-B highlights the responsibility to craft investment recommendations and maintain investment processes that are not subject to any such outside influences. As those two ideals are in conflict with each other, CFA Members and Candidates are guided in their conduct by a recommended course of action that strikes an appropriate balance.\n\nThe discussion under Standard IV-B, \"Additional Compensation Arrangements\", discusses the inherent conflict of interest in receiving gifts and entertainment from external sources. At the same time, a total and complete ban on accepting anything from anyone seems excessively cautious. The Handbook suggests that members may accept modest gifts, which it specifically defines as being anything worth less than US$100, as long as they do not affect objectivity.\n\nMore on Gifts and Perks\nAnother important note to remember about gifts and perks is that they are viewed differently depending on the source. In particular, gifts and perks from companies or other entities that could be seeking to influence the actions of the CFA member are seen as a direct challenge to independent and objective conduct, and they are thus generally regarded as a potentially more serious violation. Gifts from a client, by contrast, are seen as less likely to affect one's independence and objectivity. To be sure, even these gifts are enough of a concern to have necessitated the creation of Standard III-D, requiring full disclosure in these matters (if the gift exceeds US$100 in value). In any case, the CFA member or candidate must ask whether receipt of the gift will compromise the ability to remain objective and make independent judgments. \n\nApplying Standard I-B\nComplying with standards of independence and objectivity seems simple and straightforward in theory, but in practice there are many scenarios that could potentially conflict with one's objectivity - or create the appearance of doing so. In many cases it is not so easy to define the proper course of action. Here are some of the situations that are more likely to appear on the exam:\n\n\nA company sponsors an analyst conference and picks up all the expenses. Consider a situation where a firm invites all Wall Street analysts who are actively covering its company to go on an all-expenses-paid trip to tour facilities, play golf, stay in a swanky resort and so forth, all in the hopes of promoting itself and earning more favorable coverage. For analysts bound by the Code and Standards, would this sort of outing compromise their objectivity? The answer is that it just might. This Standard requires CFA members to assess if such an outing is possible while still maintaining objectivity - would they still be able to write an unfavorable opinion, if warranted by independent analysis? Many firms have created policies that require attendance at such affairs to be paid by the firm and require the itinerary to be substantially business-related as a condition of attending. No specific checklist of right and wrong is written into this Standard, but the mere appearance of conflict is a real issue in today's environment and one must be sensitive to perception. \n\n\nA financial firm promises to provide research coverage of a company's stock in return for a potential business relationship. This agreement is acceptable so long as there is absolutely no requirement to make the recommendation a favorable one. This standard requires that any conclusions be made in an independent and objective manner.\n\n\nIn the previous example, the relationship manager asks for a favorable recommendation for the new corporate client. This case would violate Standard I-B. If the relationship manager is concerned that an unfavorable research opinion will adversely affect the cultivation of this relationship, the research department would need to restrict the company from analyst coverage and only provide factual information without any specific recommendation. Under no circumstances can the corporate client be seen as \"buying\" a favorable analyst opinion.\n\n\nA research analyst assigned to a new sector is told by the director of research not to change the investment opinion on a certain company. This type of supervision would violate the analyst's requirement to reach an independent conclusion. If the analyst is a CFA Member or Candidate, he or she should proceed by informing the supervisor that he or she is bound by the Code and Standards, and that such a restriction is not permitted by the Standard on Independence and Objectivity. Another approach would be to study the company, reach an independent conclusion and share this opinion with the director of research, but leave it to the supervisor to decide the appropriate course of action. \n\n\nA portfolio manager receives an expensive vacation package from a brokerage as a sign of gratitude for all the business. Accepting such a perk is a violation, as it compromises the manager's objectivity in regards to choosing brokers that suit the best interests of the clients and the firm (the broker offering the best execution, for example). This manager would be in compliance with Standards if he or she disclosed the perk in writing to his or her immediate supervisor. If the firm required this manager to refuse the vacation package, he or she would be required to abide by the decision of the firm.\n\n\nA portfolio manager is sent two extra tickets to a local baseball game (face value $30 each), complements of the same brokerage. Given the rule of thumb that gifts lower than US$100 are perceived as sufficiently modest and are thus acceptable from both clients and business partners, the portfolio manager would not be violating Standard I-B, even if the perk went unreported. At the same time, it's a sensible practice to disclose even gifts of this nature - the Standards of Professional Conduct describe minimum standards, but staying in the habit of full disclosure should always be the preferred course of action.\n\n\nA CFA member who is also a member of the local society of financial analysts solicits corporate financial support for an investor conference and issues research reports on some of those same firms. Research opinions must be unbiased. However, when an analyst takes on an outside role, how will these secondary activities influence the research? If a firm pledges generous support to this analyst, will the analyst's future research reports become more favorable? If another firm declines support, will a report on that company be less favorable? The best course of action would be to trade the coverage of those firms with a colleague, or to ask to be excused from seeking sponsors. \n\nHow to Comply\r\nThe Standards of Practice Handbook provides a number of operational suggestions that one should recommend for adoption by the compliance department.\n\n\nHighlight the integrity of the research\n\n\n\r\n\t\t- Establish that research opinions reflect unbiased opinions, and include this wording on all written reports. Salary and bonuses should be independent of any factors that might compromise the degree of independence - i.e. don't tie a quarterly bonus to the fees collected from corporate relationships (which can be affected by a stock recommendation).\n\n\nDisclose conflicts of interest - For example, a directorship in a public company would need to be acknowledged by the employer, as this fact may affect research opinions of that company and of competitors. Research reports should disclose whether the analyst owns shares in a company and whether the analyst's firm makes a market in that security or has underwritten the security.\n\n\nLimit direct investments in equity or equity-related IPOs - Investment firms should establish formal policies relative to employee purchase of equity and equity-related IPOs and require prior approval.\n\n\nReport holdings - Report holdings in all personal accounts, those of one's immediate family and those over which the analyst has formal discretion (e.g. trusts).\n\n\nEstablish a restricted list - This is to limit research on those firms that have a business relationship with that company. If an adverse opinion would hurt this business relationship, the company stock should be restricted from the research universe, and only factual information on the company should be disseminated.\n\n\nCost reimbursement procedures - Identify what is acceptable and what is unacceptable practice in order to avoid the appearance of a conflict. While there is no specific checklist in the Standards, the general rule of thumb is that air transport, ground transport and hotel accommodations should be the responsibility of the individual and his or her company, and should not be covered by (for example) the issuer of a security that an analyst has started to cover. The reason that no checklist has been developed is that there are always exceptions - for example, if the issuer of a preferred security is an energy company that is headquartered in a sparsely populated area (near its coal mines) and commercial transport is not available, and the only practical way to arrange a face-to-face meeting is by using a corporate jet, then an analyst can accept such an arrangement without violating this Standard.\n\n\nLimit gifts - Gifts should be limited to a maximum value of US$100.\n\n\nPeriodically review guidelines - This is to reinforce dos and don'ts for all employees and determine whether additional guidelines are sensible.\n\n\nCompliance Officer - Firms should appoint a senior-level compliance officer who ensures the code of ethics and all regulations are upheld.\n\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_5", "text": "\nMembers and Candidates must not knowingly make any misrepresentations relating to investment analysis, recommendations, actions, or other professional activities.\n\nReasoning behind Standard I-C\nThis Standard addresses a longstanding tendency in the investment industry, particularly among those charged with directly selling products and services to the public, to make guarantees and assurances in relation to the performance of investment products that will in fact vary in the future depending on uncertain market factors. Since a large base of clients will have varying levels of investment sophistication, there are likely to be some clients who will believe just about anything they are told. This Standard seeks to tone down the hyperbole and the rhetoric and require that the investment industry's sales and marketing efforts strive for a higher tone and avoid imperfect, improper, false or misleading statements about what an organization is and what it can do. \n\nFinancial services firms tend to develop numerous forms of communication in an effort to market their services, and the scope of this Standard is designed to broadly cover oral presentations, written materials (research reports, market letters, books, magazine articles, newspaper articles), advertisements (brochures, TV and radio commercials, direct mailings) and electronic communication (websites, chat rooms, email).\n\nPlagiarism - Background\nInvestment decisions are made using a variety of financial data and information assembled in the research process: everything from corporate-issued press releases and annual reports to Wall Street brokerage research and findings and conclusions made in academic studies. This research typically forms the basis for a written report by the analyst making a recommendation. \n\nStudying these published research reports and presentations often yields very useful economic insights. When the information or insight is of such high quality, there can be a temptation to replicate the same ideas when making investment conclusions and presenting them in a research report. The CFA Institute recognizes that analysts will borrow ideas from each other and include those ideas in written reports, but it seeks to assign proper credit to the people who originated an idea or wrote the original opinion. When copying or using someone else's words or ideas, the writer must acknowledge the source.\n\nSince almost all CFA candidates are either college graduates or are currently enrolled in a degree program, they should be familiar with the cautions against plagiarism, given that most college degree programs involve a fair amount of researching and writing of term papers. In other words, you should find the guidelines easy to understand, and it should be straightforward to identify possible violations. \n\nHere are a few examples of violations of Standard I-C:\n\n\nPutting your name on another analyst's research report.\n\nIncluding a large portion of another analyst's report in your own (either verbatim or with slight modifications) without crediting the original author.\n\nNeglecting to specifically give credit to a person who has been quoted. For example, saying \"a top analyst in the field suggests...\" would be a violation.\n\nWhen including financial data, you neglect to include any caveats that must be included with that data. Although this is not plagiarism, it is still a violation of the Standard.\n\nWhat Conduct Is/Is Not Permitted?\nStandard I-C specifically addresses the traditional view of plagiarism as an unacknowledged or unauthorized borrowing of ideas and statements from written materials, though its scope is extended to cover all forms of plagiarism, from oral presentations, to audio/visual materials, to any form of electronic media. The guiding ethical principle is to \"give credit where credit is due\". Given that many of these materials are explicitly copyrighted, a plagiarist exposes him or herself to violating copyright laws and facing possible civil litigation by the author or the publisher. To the members of the CFA Institute, plagiarism is an offensive and insidious practice.\n\nException - Public Financial Data\nInformation that is already widely available to the public and distributed via a number of sources does not need to be acknowledged, according to the CFA Institute's view of plagiarism. For example, say you publish a research report on Microsoft, and you draw some basic statistical data from Yahoo! Finance, which gives the closing price of Microsoft Corporation (Nasdaq:MSFT) on April 1, 2009 as $19.13, and a dividend of $0.13 payable at the end of each quarter. In your report, you could simply state that data as fact and would not be required to explicitly give any credit to Yahoo!. However, if you copy a comment that Smith Barney's software analyst made about Microsoft's new release, it's not factual information that's part of the public domain; it's an opinion that must be acknowledged - and depending on how it is used, permission must be obtained to use the opinion.\n\nThe definition of \"recognized reporting service\" is a broad one, and one for which different people will have different standards. Earlier, we gave the example of using Yahoo! Finance as a source for pricing and dividend data on a company report, without acknowledging or referring to Yahoo!. To us, Yahoo! (which is internet based and free to use) can be reliable for such basics. Others will insist that Yahoo! Finance is hardly a recognized source of data, and that if one is using Yahoo!, one should acknowledge it as a source, since it does not meet the definition of \"recognized reporting service\" as intended by Standard I-C. Premium databases such as Standard and Poor's, Factset or Morningstar are operated by a professional staff that ensures the data is clean, and they would certainly be usable without acknowledgment under this Standard. Defining a recognized reporting service is open to interpretation.\n\nApplying Standard I-C\nMisrepresentation can take a number of forms, and it frequently can be an unintentional or careless oversight. For example, say a portfolio manager with 20 years experience leaves the firm, yet the company's website continues to highlight the average years of experience of the investment personnel, factoring in the person who just left. Who's in charge of updating the website? Whoever it is, he or she hasn't done anything about it yet - and if the information is still on the website, it's a misrepresentation and a violation of this Standard.\n\nOther Categories of Information That Are Often Misrepresented \n\n\nProfessional services - For example, small financial services firms tend to specialize in a given area, such as 401(k) planning or insurance products or tax preparation. A CFA member in charge of such a firm cannot hold himself out to be a comprehensive provider of all these financial needs.\n\n\nProfessional credentials - A recent college graduate and CFA candidate passes one of the FINRA licensing exams and then holds herself out as a licensed investment advisor and portfolio management expert, printing these titles on marketing brochures.\n\n\nExpected return on an investment - A representative from a bank makes a presentation on a mutual fund that specializes in real estate, saying the following: \"You want to allocate a portion of your diversified portfolio to real estate. This fund is up 98% over the last four years, and when you add that 98% gain to your account for the next four years, it will offset the stagnant cash and bond investments and allow you to reach your goals.\"\n\n\nExpected risk on an investment - Derivative securities of fixed income products are sometimes described as \"government guaranteed\" when in fact the interest portion fluctuates and will decline in periods of high interest rates. Using the idea of a guarantee masks the true risk of the security.\n\nHow to Comply\n\n\nDefine firm's limits - Continually reinforce what the company can do, and what it cannot do. Provide clear guidance to sales and marketing specialists who may have an inclination to promote without restraint, if left unsupervised. The line between appropriate and inappropriate exaggerations can be subtle.\n\n\nDescribe firm's services - Ensure that all contact people are discussing the firm's capabilities in a manner that is accurate and suitable.\n\n\nIdentify authorized spokespeople - Who can speak on behalf of the organization? The essential message can be controlled by simply limiting who may provide it.\n\n\nAssign the support staff - These should be reliable people who will keep written and electronic materials updated and avoid unintentional misrepresentations.\n\n\nPrepare a resume - Do this for each key employee, specifying important credentials and capabilities as it relates to the company. \n\nPlagiarism - Case Studies \nAs with other Standards, a number of situations could be presented on the exam that may (or may not) violate this Standard, giving rise to a number of potential questions and qualifying explanations. These are the most important to consider.\n\n\nDoes an owner or managing partner have a responsibility to specifically attribute ideas or information to other members of his or her firm? The short answer: it depends. If the owner is purely acting as a representative of the firm - for example, making a presentation to a client or a prospective client - he or she can disseminate information from the firm's research department without taking the additional time to credit each individual researcher and each particular contribution someone might have made to that presentation. However, take a case where a product from a firm's quantitative research process has become recognized by the public. Let's say Bob Wilson, the owner of this firm and a CFA, is asked to appear in an industry symposium on quantitative techniques. Wilson did not actually develop the ideas or techniques himself; rather, this work was accomplished by members of the research department. However, in the context of the industry symposium, Wilson has been invited as a leading expert on quantitative research methods, and he is thus representing himself, not the firm. At the conference, he would be obligated, under Standard I-C, to give specific credit to the coworkers who were responsible for the advancement. In short, to evaluate these situations, you must determine whether the person in question is purely an agent of the firm, or is there as an expert witness, or is representing him or herself only, apart from the firm.\n\n\nIf individuals are reassigned within a research department, is the new analyst obligated to acknowledge the old analyst on a published research report? In large research shops, industry coverage is often rotated periodically, yet firms often prefer to publish research with one analyst's name. This situation introduces a dilemma. For example, if a retail analyst completes all of the work on a lengthy study of-Mart, but is then reassigned to work on consumer-products companies, how should the new retail analyst (who is a CFA candidate) handle the dissemination of the Wal-Mart research? It would be improper and a violation of Standard I-C to simply send out the previous analyst's work as if the report were the work of the new analyst (i.e. simply changing the name). At the same time, firm policy asks for published research to contain one contact name. In this case, the new analyst would need to add an appropriate written acknowledgment of the previous analyst's contribution in order to comply with the Standard.\n\n\nIf the initial idea for a quantitative financial model comes from an outside source, but it is tested and revised prior to being implemented, is it plagiarism to not acknowledge the source? These cases are not always so easy to judge, especially if the original quantitative model was changed - in such a case, the analyst can claim that the revised model actually represents his or her own \"innovation\". However, the spirit of Standard I-C is to encourage an ethic of fairness to the investment research profession. Modifying someone else's ideas to a certain extent and then passing them off as one's original discovery is a form of plagiarism and is discouraged by this Standard. In this instance, the analyst would need to give credit where credit is due by identifying the source of the new innovation and explaining how the idea originated and the measures taken to backtest or further develop or modify the concept.\n\n\nCan an employee plagiarize information from his or her own firm? If an individual uses portions of their employer's in-house publications in a way that they are acting as an agent for another individual or company, it would be considered plagiarism and a violation of Standard I-C.\n\nThis final example also pointed out that the individual \"may have violated the Standard on \"Duty to Employer\". The CFA exam has been known to present situations with violations of multiple Standards, and it's up to the candidate to identify (on a multiple choice format) \"which Standard is NOT being violatedU\"U. In the case of the plagiarizer of the marketing brochures, he might be violating copyright laws (and thus, Standard I), but would not be guilty of insider trading (Standard II-A). Such problems give the CFA examiners a way to test several Standards within the context of one problem.\n\nAvoiding Plagiarism\n\n\nMaintain research files - By keeping a comprehensive paper trail of the process by which all investment ideas are generated and the specific source of all research materials cited in preparing a report, the analyst protects him or herself from charges that these findings or ideas were plagiarized.\n\n\nUse direct quotes - Do this if an idea is going to be borrowed, and attribute the source of all directly quoted passages, as well as all statistics, charts, tables and other material that was developed and published by another source.\n\n\nObtain permission - If the report is to be publicly disseminated, get permission to use any material that is copyrighted by a publisher. In the case of quantitative financial models, the originator of the model may have licensed its use, and a fee may be required in addition to acknowledgment.\n\n\nAttribute paraphrased or summarized material - While this material does not necessarily meet the stated definition of plagiarism, it should be attributed to its rightful source. For example, a lengthy research report on General Motors may include summaries on Ford, DaimlerChrysler and Toyota that were written by other analysts, mostly to give some context to the GM analysis. Even in summarized format, these commentaries have been borrowed from others, and in a spirit of fairness, proper credit should be explicitly offered.\n\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_6", "text": "\nMembers and Candidates must not engage in any professional conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, or deceit or commit any act that reflects adversely on their professional reputation, integrity, or competence.\n\nReasoning behind Standard I-D\r\nThis Standard was written with the understanding that simple compliance with all laws, rules and regulations (i.e. the essence of Standard I-A) is in a number of cases not enough to create a highly ethical culture for the investments profession. Standard I-D thus extends beyond the scope of Standard I-A to address the personal integrity of Members and Candidates. For example, there is no law, rule or regulation preventing one from drinking alcoholic beverages before going to work or while at lunch and returning to work while under the influence. It's also true that such behavior was socially acceptable decades ago with the popularity of the so-called three-martini lunch. But times have changed.\n\r\nIn today's culture, such behavior is clearly viewed as adversely impairing one's judgment and reasoning. It reflects poorly not just on that individual, but on the person's firm and on investment professionals in general. While the language of Standard I-D is open to interpretation (and one could debate whether the rule is being violated in certain situations), the overriding spirit of Standard I-D is that the investment management business is very image conscious, and Members and Candidates must assume that their conduct is being judged - not just by clients, coworkers or supervisors, but in relation to the profession as a whole.\n\nWhat type of specific conduct constitutes a violation of Standard I-D? Even if your conduct within your professional workplace is impeccable, the activities you partake in after-hours can also constitute a violation of the Standard.\n\r\nFor example; if an individual has been convicted of a felony, crime, or misdemeanor, that person has indicated to others that he or she partakes in immoral, dishonest, and unethical activities. Who's to say this behavior will not be repeated within his or her professional activities?\n\nApplying Standard I-D\nCFA candidates typically know the difference between right and wrong, so exam questions will try to trap you with various qualifiers to a situation. Be aware that the most important thing to evaluate is what the person actually has done, and avoid the following traps:\n\n\nDon't rely on the judgment of the individual's supervisor - Many examples will indicate that \"a supervisor didn't find that the behavior in question affected day-to-day responsibilities, and the supervisor knew about it but was OK with it as long as it didn't happen again\". In these cases, the opinion of the supervisor is not important - it's the actual act that must be your focus. Don't worry about the supervisor. Keep the analysis simple: do the actions of this person violate any facet of the Standards? (Is it a felony? Does it involve fraud or an act of moral turpitude?)\n\n\nDon't forgive misconduct simply because there is no conviction - In our legal system, most cases get settled out of court. If an activity is fraudulent, if the perpetrator tried to get away with something or tried to deceive, it's a violation of Standard I-D even if the misconduct doesn't result in a conviction. Again, focus on what the person did.\n\n\nDishonesty and fraud are possible even when one is engaged in volunteering for charitable causes - Focus on what the person has actually done. If it is fraudulent, if it misrepresents, or if it is deceitful, then it's a violation.\n\nHow to Comply\r\nPersonal integrity and professional conduct start with the individual, with one's sense of right and wrong behavior, and with one's moral character. Improper and inappropriate actions have consequences, but in a position of trust, one is sometimes in a position to get away with fraudulent behavior. If an action provokes the feeling that you hope no one else finds out, it's probably something that shouldn't be done. You should never feel like you have something to hide.\n\r\nIn addition to the CFA Institute, the Securities and Exchange Commission, FINRA, and many other governing and regulatory bodies are in place to provide a regulatory framework and require compliance and full disclosure of one's activities. In addition, CFA Members and Candidates should encourage employers to adopt a code of ethics to cover personal conduct for everyone in the organization, and to adopt background-checking procedures for potential employees, so that an organization is fully aware of any prior legal issues and is confident that potential employees are not ineligible for employment in the investment industry.\n        \n        \n            \n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_7", "text": "\nStandard II: Integrity of Capital Markets\r\nStandard II consists of two subsections:\n\n\r\n\t\tII-A: Material Nonpublic Information\n\r\n\t\tII-B: Market Manipulation\n\nStandard II-A: Material Nonpublic Information\r\nMembers and Candidates who possess material nonpublic information that could affect the value of an investment must not act or cause others to act on the information.\n\nReasoning behind Standard II-A\r\nAs long as there has been a stock market, buying or selling based on an insider tip has been a common practice. Before there were Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) guidelines prohibiting the practice - and long before there was a CFA Institute devoted to increasing public awareness of insider dealing - corporate insiders enjoyed a distinct advantage in trading their securities. This advantage has resulted in numerous scandals. On the buy side, an insider whose stock is trading at $25 a share could forge a buyout at $50, but wait to announce the merger until the insider (and a few privileged friends and family) bought the stock aggressively in order to make a quick profit. On the other side, if a company loses a major customer or a key executive, the insiders (in the absence of insider trading laws) could dump all of their shares prior to announcing the negative information, thus avoiding a big loss.\n\nWhy Is This Wrong? \r\nIn spite of the detailed regulations set out by the SEC and the CFA Institute (among others), the news stories and the public awareness campaigns, some will look at insider dealing and not really see why it should be such a big deal. After all, people know that investing comes with risk, and they assume that certain people will have advantages over others in terms of access to information. Moreover, if we know our stock is about to go down because of a yet-to-be-released news story or event, why shouldn't we avoid our loss and cash in? The issue (at its core) has to do with public confidence and a system requiring fairness. People invest in stocks and bonds because they are confident that the price they are paying reflects all public information on the stock. If the public did not have this confidence, many would not be investing in retirement funds at all, while others would refuse to pay the prices they do. Regulating the system by prohibiting insider dealing has created trillions in market value and helped millions reach their retirement goals. Yes, these laws do have unfair consequences for a few (the people who know a stock is going to go down but can't trade on this information because it's not public), but in the end, far more people benefit from a system that requires fairness.\n\nDefinition of Material Nonpublic Information\r\nCan I trade on this? Do I have to wait to trade on that? In order to clarify what conduct is prohibited by Standard II-A, the term \"material nonpublic information\" has been coined to help guide Members and Candidates in certain situations.\n\r\nTake each component individually:\n\n\nMaterial\r\n\t\tThis means the information would be considered relevant to an investor who is considering investing in this stock, or to a current shareholder wishing to sell. If a stock reflects all public information, does adding this new information significantly alter the perception of that stock?\n\r\n\t\tMaterial information would include the following:\r\n\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\tDividend increase, decrease or omission\n\r\n\t\t\t\tQuarterly earnings or sales significantly different from consensus\n\r\n\t\t\t\tGain or loss of a major customer\n\r\n\t\t\t\tChanges in management\n\r\n\t\t\t\tMajor development specific to that industry\n\r\n\t\t\t\tGovernment reports of economic trends (housing starts, employment etc.)\n\r\n\t\t\t\tMajor acquisition or divestiture\n\r\n\t\t\t\tOffer is made to tender shares (acquisition)\n\n\n\nMaterial versus Non-Material\r\n\t\tNo statutory definition of \"materiality\" is available, so it is up to courts that rule on insider trading cases to rule. These cases will often cite the market price impact of the released information to establish that it was indeed material. Say a dividend is cut in half and the shares fall 10%; it was clearly a material event. However, if a company announces a new branch office in Kansas, and the stock performs in line with the market following the announcement, it was a non-material event. An insider with knowledge of the Kansas venture would not be found criminally liable if there were a purchase of shares prior to the public announcement of the Kansas office.\n\nThe source of the information also impacts its materiality. The more reliable the source, the more likely it is that the information is material. For example, if you're riding the commuter train and overhear the CFO of an energy company tell his assistant that he's about to announce a plunge in quarterly corporate earnings, and you immediately call your broker to sell your shares, then the information is material and non-public and standard II(A) has been violated. On the other hand, if you sell your shares based on a recommendation from your dentist, who happens to follow the energy sector as a hobby and thinks this particular company is under strain, that source of information is unreliable and therefore not material. \n\n\nRegarding Analyst Opinion on a Stock\r\n\t\tAsk whether the information is material: i.e. will it have a market impact? If an influential Wall Street analyst is preparing to downgrade his or her investment opinion from a buy to a sell, and we know about it, that's very different from our neighborhood broker/dealer stating he doesn't like it anymore. In the first case, we are required to wait for public disclosure of the change in opinion; the second case requires no trading restrictions.\n\n\nNonpublic \r\n\t\tThe information is yet to be disclosed to the general marketplace.\n\n\n\n\n\nLook Out!\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSelective disclosure? When information is disclosed selectively, i.e. just to a handful of investment analysts, or perhaps on a conference call, or in an email, the information may still be regarded as nonpublic. Companies are bound by specific procedures designed to make the information truly public and to ensure a system of fairness in which all market participants are given a chance to act on the information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDid the Insider Breach a Duty? \r\nStandard II-A includes language that prohibits use of information obtained in breach of a duty. Essentially it means that this insider should have avoided disclosing this information but failed to do so.\n\r\nWhat was the motivation? Will the insider benefit from this breach in one of the following ways?\r\n\n\nPecuniary Benefit - The insider's investment position is affected, or the insider's reputation (and future potential salary) is enhanced.\n\nQuid Pro Quo - The tipper expects something in return from the recipient.\n\nGift - An insider wants friends and family to benefit from this information.\n\nThe Analyst's Role \r\nIn an efficient market, an analyst must retain the freedom to study a company and act on information not always contained in the public press releases. Analysts are encouraged to gather and use two forms of legal information:\n\n\nMaterial Public Information - Annual reports can contain volumes of data and discussion that could be material and are perhaps yet to be discovered.\n\n\nNon-Material Nonpublic Information - Discussions with management may reveal information that isn't obviously material but that may give valuable clues.\n\nApplying Standard II-A\r\nExam questions covering this Standard are likely to test whether a CFA candidate can understand and identify violations of the Standard and understand and identify actions (e.g. the mosaic theory, firewalls) that help prevent a violation of the Standard.\n\r\nWe'll present each of these categories of questions separately.\n\n\nUnderstand/Identify Violations - Hundreds of real-life situations can touch on a possible violation of the insider trading laws, and frequently it is not obvious whether a person has acted inappropriately. As a rule, if you obtain information that is not public and it is considered material, contains a tender offer, was misappropriated, or would violate a breach of confidence you should not trade the security. If the material is already public, (or if the material is not public but contains immaterial information), you are generally free and clear of a violation.\n\r\n\t\tFor related reading on the legal and illegal forms of insider trading, see Uncovering Insider Tradingand Defining Illegal Insider Trading.\n\nConflicts to Fiduciary Duty\r\nQuestions on the exam are likely to address a CFA member's fiduciary duty to, for example, act in the best interests of pension fund holders, and whether the member is really doing his or her duty if he or she doesn't trade on insider information. Indeed, some earlier Standards require placing client interests ahead of personal interests (e.g. with personal transactions or participation in IPOs). However, the guiding principle is that a CFA member's duty to the investing public (by not acting on inside information) is greater than other duties.\n\nMosaic Theory\r\nA securities analyst will be motivated to identify mispriced stocks and will be gathering information to such an extent that exposure to nonpublic information is a possibility. However, the work of an analyst depends on the free flow of information. As a defense to a charge that nonpublic information is being used to trade on a stock, the mosaic theory suggests that the analysis of a company form a mosaic; that is, by assembling small bits of nonpublic information together, large and meaningful conclusions can be drawn. The idea behind the mosaic theory is that each individual piece of information is nonmaterial by itself: an individual piece of information would not move the price of the security if disseminated in a public press release. Taken together, however, the bits of information can form a meaningful mosaic. This practice is perfectly legitimate, and it is encouraged.\n\r\nThink of the mosaic theory as a way for analysts to do their jobs and use nonpublic information without feeling like they are at risk for liability under insider trading law. On the exam, hypothetical examples will carry identifying words - i.e. \"material\" or \"nonmaterial\" - to guide you to the right answer (material: trading restricted, non-material: no trading restrictions).\n\nHow to Comply\r\nA compliance program is incomplete if all it does is create awareness of the definition of insider trading and the fines and jail sentences to which the employee could be liable. The real work of the compliance program should be to reduce and eliminate the possibility of a violation. In the real world, there will always be temptation to either profit from (or avoid loss through) knowledge of material nonpublic information.\n\r\nThe most sensible approach is control: prevent the information from being disseminated widely, thus removing the issue of temptation for all but a few.\n\nFirewalls\r\n\"Firewall\" is a common term applied to the barriers created to prevent sensitive information from being disseminated between departments of a firm. As applied to insider trading, the assumption is that certain departments (e.g. corporate underwriting) may have access to material nonpublic information that would be useful to those in other departments (e.g. investment management and research). The guiding principle is that only certain individuals need to know certain things, and thus no one else should have any access.\n\r\nMinimum elements of a corporate firewall:\n\n\nSegregation of Personnel - Someone involved with investment banking should not be doing research and trading, and vice versa.\n\n\nConfinement of Material Nonpublic Information - Employees have access only on a need-to-know basis.\n\n\nControl of Interdepartmental Communications - The compliance or legal functions of a firm might serve as a clearing house through which all interdepartmental memoranda are sent.\n\n\nMonitoring of Employee Trading - Those with particularly sensitive jobs might be required to pre-clear, that is, to receive permission in advance.\n\n\nRestricted List - The creation and maintenance of a restricted list can help limit employee trading as needed.\n\n\nHeightened Restrictions under Certain Conditions - For example, additional restrictions might be placed when material nonpublic information is received in the course of underwriting a new preferred stock placement.\n\r\nThe following are some other procedures that may be adopted as part of a compliance program:\n\n\nCommunicate Receipt of Information - Companies come into contact with material nonpublic information in a variety of ways. When such a situation occurs, the recipient must be obligated to inform his or her supervisor or compliance officer and not disclose any additional information to coworkers.\n\n\nMake Reasonable Efforts to Make Nonpublic Information Public - If material nonpublic information was received, particularly in breach of a duty or as a result of a misappropriation, it is possible that this information was eventually going to be made public. While Standard II-A prevents acting on that information while it is not public, the duty to client requires that investment action (should it be required) be made in light of the new information. For example, if new, nonpublic information makes it clear that a firm will be in violation of a bond covenant and its fixed-income securities will be downgraded to junk status, that security may no longer meet the investment objectives of the client. However, the bond cannot be sold until the information is made public. In such an instance, reasonable measures may involve a written request between the firm's compliance department and a legal representative of the firm that issued the bond.\n\n\nKeep Record of Research and a Rationale for Each Investment Decision - This procedure, most applicable to Standard V-A, Reasonable Basis, can help protect an analyst who has employed the mosaic theory and used several items of nonmaterial, nonpublic information to form an investment opinion.\n\n\nWatch List - Depending on the size of an organization, the placement of a company on a restricted list can have the unintended side effect of communicating to a wide audience that something is going on at that company. In this case, the firewall may be unintentionally broken, and while employees might be restricted from trading, the leak can find its way outside in a number of ways (it only takes one person to provide an insider tip). In situations where placing a firm on a restricted list is too public, a firm can adopt the use of a watch list, which means the compliance department will monitor activity on the companies on that list, perhaps making inquiries based on an individual's activities, but maintaining the confidentiality needed for a particular circumstance.\n\n\nTraining/Continuing Education - Some employees will be more knowledgeable about insider trading laws (and the need to have them) than others. A comprehensive agenda needs to outline all issues related to insider trading, identify both individual and firm liability under these regulations and summarize procedures for compliance, such as the reporting of personal transactions.\n\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_8", "text": "\n        Members and Candidates must not engage in practices that distort prices or artificially inflate trading volume with the intent to mislead market participants.\n\nReasoning behind Standard II-B\r\nAs markets evolve, standards of conduct must evolve with them. The CFA Institute's role in promoting the need for integrity in publicly-traded capital markets has traditionally covered the use of material nonpublic information, but there are other ways to engage in unethical and unfair conduct.\n\r\nStandard II-B is intended to cover two types of activities:\n\n1. Transaction-Based Manipulation - This Standard is intended to prohibit activities designed to distort - for example, if an institutional investor with more than one account were to trade a micro-cap stock between two accounts with the sole intention of creating artificial volume and drawing attention to the stock. The capital markets have established a number of price-setting mechanisms that can be artificially distorted to create a perception that there is strength or weakness in a particular security, or a certain level of trading volume. \n\r\nThis Standard also covers those market participants who attempt to secure a \"dominant\" market position in a security and artificially inflate the price in an effort to benefit from a related (derivative) instrument.\n\n2. Disseminating False Information - Some examples of this behavior include spreading false rumors that prompt others to buy or sell, or \"pumping up\" a price by issuing overly positive or optimistic projections, then \"dumping\" the stock once it has rallied. Another example would be if companies hired to promote a recently issued small-cap stock were to issue \"independent research\" that only served to promote that company. This scheme is also referred to as a \"pump and dump\" strategy.\n\nHow to Comply \r\nEstablish a compliance program that sets out rules of conduct for those engaged in market transactions, as well as a set of rules governing any activities that involve the distribution or promotion of information on a publicly-traded company.\n        \n        \n            \n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_9", "text": "\nStandard III: Duties to Clients\r\nStandard III consists of five subsections:\n\n\r\n\t\tIII-A: Loyalty, Prudence, and Care\n\r\n\t\tIII-B: Fair Dealing\n\r\n\t\tIII-C: Suitability\n\r\n\t\tIII-D: Performance Presentation\n\r\n\t\tIII-E: Preservation of Confidentiality\n\nStandard III-A: Loyalty, Prudence and Care\r\nMembers and Candidates have a duty of loyalty to their clients and must act with reasonable care and exercise prudent judgment. Members and Candidates must act for the benefit of their clients and place their clients' interests before their employer's or their own interests. In relationships with clients, Members and Candidates must determine applicable fiduciary duty and must comply with such duty to persons and interests to whom it is owed.\n\nReasoning behind Standard III-A\nStandard III (A) reminds CFA members and candidates that client interests come first. Because a money manager typically has superior investment knowledge, the client/manager relationship is unequal and presumes a level of client trust. Investment professionals must therefore ensure that a client's portfolio is managed with the same care and good sense that they might apply if their own money were at risk.  Identify the Client\nIt sounds easy enough, but identifying the client who is owed your loyalty is not always so clear-cut. For example, the trustee of an employee pension plan may hire an investment manager to buy common shares of the company's stock to thwart a takeover bid, but that may disadvantage the true clients of the pension fund; that is, its plan participants and beneficiaries. Likewise, in the case of a family trust, the client(s) are probably the beneficiaries of the trust, not the individual who hired the investment manager.\n\nDevelop the Client's Portfolio\nMoney managers must work with the client to establish appropriate goals, expectations, and risk levels. This means developing an investment policy centered on the client's best, long-term objectives. Particular care should be taken to disclose potential conflicts of interests, such as selling your own firm's products. All decisions should consider the client's total portfolio.\n\n\n\nSoft Dollars \nThis refers to an agreement between a broker/dealer's trading function and an investment manager, where brokerages offer to provide certain products and services (pay soft dollars) to the investment manager in exchange for the manager directing trades to the broker. The manager absolutely must continue to seek best price and execution for trades under his or her discretion, and must not simply direct all trades to the broker providing the soft dollars. The member or candidate must disclose to the client in those instances where directed brokerage may not be providing the best execution at the best price. \n\nProxy Voting\nShareholders have the ultimate authority, through exercising voting rights, to direct how a publicly-traded organization is to be managed. Since many investment management agreements delegate this authority to the manager, the institutional manager who oversees a large number of accounts may have significant power in the corporate governance process. \n\nPart of a Member's or Candidate's duty of loyalty includes voting proxies when they have an economic benefit to their client. \n\nBeing careful and loyal does not, however, exempt a member or candidate from transactions and whether members place client interests ahead of their own. Some examples might be similar to the ones below:\n\n(1) Identifying the Client \u2013 The portfolio manager of a global financial services mutual fund runs into a friend at an industry event. His friend mentions that her new client is invested in the portfolio manager's fund and therefore the two of them now share responsibility for her new client. Under standard III(A), this is incorrect. The portfolio manager's duty is to uphold the investment guidelines for his mutual fund with objectivity and independence, while his friend's duty is to be loyal to her new client.\n\n(2) Brokerage Arrangements \u2013 A small, independent investment advisor manages the pension funds of several companies. One of her brokers is about to win several new client accounts. The advisor expects to manage and trade these accounts exclusively through that broker. To induce the broker to send more new accounts her way, the investment advisor directs trades for all her current clients to that broker, without their knowledge. The advisor violated standard III(A) by not seeking best practice and best execution on all trades. Additionally, the standard was violated because the advisor did not disclose how trades were directed.\n\n(3) Excessive Trading \u2013 A CFA charterholder manages money for several high-net-worth families. A major part of his compensation comes in the form of fees based on trading volume. He trades excessively for his accounts, but all the trades made are appropriate and suitable assets for the clients. The manager has violated standard III(A) because he is using the assets of his clients to benefit himself.\n\nHow to Comply\r\nTo ensure compliance with Standard III-A and to avoid a violation, CFA members and Candidates should start by thoroughly knowing and understanding the content of all governing documents to which they are bound in their relationships with clients. Given the duty to loyalty required by this Standard, are there any particular restrictions or unique characteristics that are not fully understood? Legal advice should be sought for unclear guidelines.\n\r\nWhen in custodial control of client assets, the following procedures are suggested (per the Standards of Practice Handbook):\n\n\n\r\n\t\tAudit the firm at least once a year.\n\r\n\t\tProduce a quarterly statement for each client, indicating funds and securities in that account and itemized transactions during the period.\n\r\n\t\tMake full disclosure as to where the assets are maintained, and where and when they are moved.\n\r\n\t\tSeparate assets so that each client's holdings can be distinguished.\n\r\nTo comply with soft-dollar standards, a fiduciary needs to ask three questions to determine whether soft dollars can be used and what percentage of the cost can be allocated:\n\r\n1. Does this product provide investment research?\n\r\n2. Will the information it provides contribute to the research process of this organization?\n\r\n3. Will any portion of this product go for uses not directly involved in the investment research process?\n\r\nFor investment managers, an internal policies and procedures guide should observe the following rules:\n\n\r\n\t\tAll applicable laws, rules and regulations must be followed.\n\r\n\t\tPotential conflict of interest arrangements (additional compensation, outside directorships) are required disclosures.\n\r\n\t\tInvestment objectives for each client must be initially established and reviewed at least annually and as circumstances warrant.\n\r\n\t\tAsset diversification should be practiced as a risk reduction tool, except in cases where specific guidelines and objectives preclude it.\n\r\n\t\tFairness and objectivity should be practiced with all clients, with no explicit favoritism toward one client or group.\n\r\n\t\tA process for vote proxies should be established with clients' best interests in mind; individual responsibilities for voting should be determined; and records should be maintained.\n\r\n\t\tBest execution on trades should be practiced. In other words, under the particular circumstances in place (i.e. what is reasonably available), what is the broker that provides the lowest total cost to the client? \"Cost\" refers not only to trading commissions but also to costs related to poorly executed trades (buying at prices that are higher and selling at prices that are lower than what was available from competitors).\n\r\n\t\tDuty of loyalty to clients, as a company policy, is top priority.\n\nEthics problems on the CFA exam are usually case-study oriented. Keep in mind that many cases involve violations of more than one standard. A good way to determine whether standard III(A) was breached is to ask yourself the following questions: \n\n1. Is this person acting in the best interests of clients? \n2. Is this person placing clients' interests before his or her own?\n\r\n\u00a0\n\nThese are simple guidelines to remember and a \"no\" answer to either question will indicate a potential violation.\n\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_10", "text": "\n        Members and Candidates must deal fairly and objectively with all clients when providing investment analysis, making investment recommendations, taking investment action, or engaging in other professional activities.\n\nReasoning behind Standard III-B\nThe Standard on fair dealing responds to the inclination to show overt favoritism toward one's largest and most profitable clients. In addition, this Standard (as well as the next one on the list regarding Priority of Transactions) highlights the temptation to place self-interest ahead of client interest. One of the CFA Institute's stated goals is to build and maintain the public's trust. Clients who hire an investment advisor have a right to trust that their advisor will not discriminate against them, simply because they represent a smaller account or a less established relationship. \n\nWhile the biggest and most important clients are likely to end up receiving more attention (perhaps they will receive more shirts with the company logo on them, or play more complementary rounds of golf), this Standard focuses on the issue that matters most: the actual dissemination of changes in investment outlook and the actual trading of securities. When changes to the investment portfolio are made, procedures must be developed to ensure that every client, large and small, is treated fairly. \n\nThe Standard does not require that all clients be treated equally. Keep in mind that there is a difference. If total equality were the standard, it would logically mean that any investment change (say from buy to sell) must be disclosed simultaneously. For managers with thousands of accounts, there are practical limitations to doing this. On the other hand, with the ability to simultaneously reach a large group via bulk email, what was previously seen as impractical may eventually be possible. For now, there remains a limitation to email-based announcements: some people still do not use email. \n\nStandard III-B addresses the issue of fairness with (1) the dissemination of an analyst's recommendations (particularly when they change) and (2) the actual trading on those recommendations.\n\n1. Changes in Recommendation - This first part is specifically directed at those within the research function of any financial services organization that manages portfolios and/or makes investment recommendations to clients. It defines an \"investment recommendation\" as an expressed opinion to buy, hold or sell a security, and it recognizes that there is a period of time between the initial decision to make a change and the public awareness of that change. During this time, that change is regarded as material nonpublic information. \n\nStandard II-A discusses the seriousness of using material nonpublic information for one's personal advantage. For the purposes of this Standard, it's important to appreciate that the opinion itself is material (knowledge of the change would prompt investment action) and nonpublic (it has yet to be traded upon); therefore, care must be taken to (a) keep the information nonpublic, until (b) a fair system to disseminate the information is utilized.\n\nPotential methods to distribute the nonpublic information include the following:\n\n\nA detailed research report\n\nA brief update summarizing what is being done, with a summary of the rationale for the change\n\nAdding or deleting from a recommended list, with additional explanation highlighting what exactly was added or taken out\n\nOral communication\n\n2. Investment Action - This second part is directed at the portfolio administrators and traders who will carry out any change. Initiating a large across-the-board order to either buy or sell a stock can potentially impact market value; thus, there must be procedures in place to ensure that the price paid for a buy (or price received on a sale) does not discriminate against any group of accounts. In other words, how will block trades - a large quantity of shares to be bought and sold - be allocated? A process is based on the circumstances of the individual firm, but this process must be (a) fair and (b) clearly disclosed, in order to give clients the opportunity to make an informed decision. \n\nFairness with Initial Public Offerings\nThe opportunity to participate in an initial public offering, or IPO, receives the most attention in relation to this Standard, as it is the process in which the standard of fairness is likely to receive its greatest test. How a broker or advisor proceeds with a hot issue (an IPO that trades at a premium in the secondary market, due to an imbalance of demand for the issue) is of particular importance, because with hot issues the broker is basically handing the recipients an automatic profit. The temptation is to hand the easy profits to the most important clients - the people providing the firm with the most revenue. However, a standard of fairness and loyalty to clients requires IPO distributions to make bona fide public distributions of these securities.\n\nOn the exam, be prepared for questions looking at cases in which an IPO is oversubscribed. This means that more shares have been requested than the broker has available. If this situation comes up, know the term \"pro rata\". This term is a Latin phrase meaning \"in proportion\". With an oversubscribed IPO, a broker would allocate shares pro rata based on a fair allocation system. It's also very important to remember that the CFA member is obligated to forego shares for personal use (or the use of immediate family) in order to uphold a standard to place client interests first. \n\nApplying Standard III-B\nCase studies that test this Standard tend to place analysts in a situation where they are tempted to show favoritism toward one group over another. In determining the proper course of action, ask whether the individual's actions in any way discriminate against any subset of the firm's client base. Some of the more common situations to anticipate in a CFA exam question testing this Standard are described below.\n\n1. Previewing Contents of a Yet-to-Be Published Research Report - An industry analyst is excited about an under-recognized company in her sector, and she is in the process of preparing a report to buy the stock. Currently the report is being fact-checked and is nonpublic information, but it will be sent to all clients following the fact-checking process. An important client calls and asks the analyst what she is currently researching. In this case, if she answers honestly, it is a violation of Standard III-B, given that the firm has a fair and defined process in place for distributing the new buy recommendation. She would simply need to tell the client that a new research report is awaiting publication and will be distributed shortly, and that she will be happy to discuss it once the client receives it.\n\n2. No Time to Prepare a Report - Another industry analyst has a buy rating on a specialty medical-devices company, and he is considered a leading Wall Street expert on the industry in general and this company in particular. His initial study was rigorously detailed, about 50 pages in length and the product of two months of preparation. Each month, his firm publishes a recommended list (where this stock has been listed for the past year), followed by company commentaries. A couple of days before the list is published, he learns that one of the major products in the pipeline awaiting FDA approval will be indefinitely delayed, prompting the analyst to question his fundamental case. He switches to a hold recommendation but concludes he doesn't have enough time to prepare a report that conforms to his rigorous research standards, so he declines additional comment and requests that his summary be excluded from the publication. In a conference call with a mutual fund manager that is the largest owner of the stock, he indicates that he was no longer recommending it due to a change in fundamentals, but that he would need some time to put the report together. The fund manager immediately sells her entire position. \n\nIs this action a violation? The analyst is in violation of Standard III-B, fair dealing. According to the Standard, he needed to recognize that his opinion counts as material information, and that if he made a change, he needed to include at least a summary outlining the reasons in the firm's monthly publication. He could follow up later with the rigor he deems necessary. As for the mutual fund manager, she is in violation of Standard V-A, Reasonable Basis, as she is trading out of the stock without knowing the detailed reasons. To avoid a violation, she would need to wait for the report to be disseminated.\n\n3. Preparing for the Eventual Demand - Take a case where a brokerage is about to publish a brand new buy recommendation. The head trader for this brokerage learns of the news and buys a large block of the shares on the open market one week prior to publication, anticipating that there will be great demand for shares of this company among the clients of the firm. The company to be recommended is a small-cap stock that is thinly traded, so there might be liquidity issues if the trader does not act. Following firm policy, the portfolio administrators will faithfully allocate shares pro rata and give everyone the exact same price. However, this case is a clear violation of Standard III-B. Moreover, it's an example of the sort of tricks that show up on the CFA exam; there's an indication in the example that pro rata allocation was used so that a test taker sees a fair allocation procedure being implemented, which might obscure the fact that the trade itself was unethical. In fact, the brokerage must adhere to strict policies on disseminating its new recommendation, and it would never bepermitted to trade ahead of a research report. Such a trade is not only a violation of the CFA Institute's Standard; the fact that it happened when it happened is likely to capture the attention of the SEC.\n\n4. Allocation of IPO - A portfolio manager occasionally will receive limited access to his firm's IPO underwriting activities. The number of shares varies depending on the outside demand for the issue, but these IPO allocations are typically insignificant compared to the accounts under management. It's never enough shares to make an across-the-board pro rata allocation worthwhile, as it would end up as an insignificant position in all portfolios. As a result, this manager simply disposes of these shares whenever she receives them by allocating them to her largest clients. Unfortunately, by allocating in this manner she is violating Standard III-B, as she systematically favors the largest portfolios (i.e. the smaller accounts never get a chance). Given that a pro rata procedure process is not always practical, the best way to comply with the Standard would be to select IPO participants at random from the entire client list and to establish a cycle where everyone must participate once before being chosen again. \n\n5. Notification via Email - A manager and CFA charterholder wishes to treat his clients fairly and also comply with the Standards of Professional Conduct. He prepares a bulk email notification of a new buy recommendation being published by his full service brokerage firm. Two days following the email, he places a block trade for discretionary accounts and for those nondiscretionary accounts that notified him of interest. Does this process violate the fairness doctrine required by Standard III-B? While it would be nice to communicate fully with everyone via email, and be confident that everyone reads his or her email, the reality is that some people do not have email access. As a result, disseminating a recommendation in this manner discriminates against non-email clients and violates the Standard on fair dealing. To comply, the manager will first need to 'snail mail' the recommendation to the full client list. \n\nHow to Comply\nAny particular compliance program is going to be a function of the unique factors present in that firm, such as its size and the scope of the activities in which it is involved. However, all procedures are going to share the common doctrine of fairness and develop processes that avoid systematic discrimination of one group of clients in favor of another.\n\r\nThe Handbook makes numerous worthwhile suggestions for developing a compliance program that adheres to the intent of this Standard:\n\n\nDisseminate Nonpublic Information as Quickly as Possible - Violations result from the fact that an analyst is required to keep a new idea secret for such a period of time that leaks develop.\n\n\nFor Lengthy and Detailed Reports, Offer a Flash Summary - No one can be expected to rewrite a 50-page report in two days. However, changing a recommendation creates material nonpublic information. It's not necessary for such information to be held for weeks while the necessary labor is done to write up the report right. A brief flash summary that includes the essence and the conclusion, plus an indication that the laborious, detailed report is in progress, is sufficient to comply with the ethic of full disclosure.\n\n\nGuidelines for Pre-Dissemination Must Be Established - This is to insure that people who have access to this information are aware of the standards.\n\n\nInform Everyone as Simultaneously as Possible - For example, a large brokerage can ensure that all branches receive the new research on the same day.\n\n\nRestrict Trading - Do not trade until all clients have a fair chance to receive the new recommendation. For example, place no trades for two to three business days following a mailing.\n\n\nDevelop a Fair Process for Trade Allocation - Some common elements might include:\r\n\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\tAll orders must be date and time-stamped.\n\r\n\t\t\t\tHave a process on a first in/first out basis, based on the time stamped.\n\r\n\t\t\t\tBlock trades receive the same execution price and commission.\n\r\n\t\t\t\tPartially executed blocks should be allocated pro rata.\n\n\n\nFor Hot IPO Issues, Obtain Indications of Interest in Advance - Allocation procedure should be systematic (e.g. pro rata, random draw) and not based on favoritism.\n\n\nDo Not Withhold Shares - Refrain from holding shares in hot issues for personal accounts, leaving out any interested clients, and make a bona fide effortto publicly distribute.\n\n\nDisclose - Discloseall trade allocation procedures to clients.\n\n\nReview Accounts Systematically - A supervisor or compliance officer can develop a process that indicates whether some accounts are being given preferential treatment - for example, whether trade executions in certain accounts appear to be better than average, or certain accounts seem to receive more shares in a hot IPO than what would be expected.\n\n\nDisclose the Presence of Tiers of Service - Many organizations offer both discretionary and nondiscretionary advisory service, but because of the differences in those accounts, they might find it necessary for practical reasons to take action in the discretionary accounts first, before they take the same action within the nondiscretionary accounts. Such procedure is not discriminatory since discretionary accounts are paying a premium; however, clients must be fully aware of this practice. \n\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_11", "text": "\n        1.When Members and Candidates are in an advisory relationship with a client, they must:\n\r\na) make a reasonable inquiry into a client's or prospective client's investment experience, risk and return objectives, and financial constraints prior to making any investment recommendation or taking investment action and must reassess and update this information regularly.\n\r\nb) determine that an investment is suitable to the client's financial situation and consistent with the client's written objectives, mandates and constraints before making an investment recommendation or taking investment action.\n\r\nc) judge the suitability of investments in the context of the client's total portfolio.\n\r\n2.When Members and Candidates are responsible for managing a portfolio according to a specific mandate, strategy or style, they must only make investment recommendations or take investment actions that are consistent with the stated objectives and constraints of the portfolio.\n\nReasoning behind Standard III-C\r\nOn a simple level, most people have the same concept in mind when consulting a financial professional: \"make me money\". The reality is much more complicated. Countless stories can be told of an inexperienced young stockbroker who assumes everyone is the same and sells every single client and prospect on the prevailing hot idea, only to discover that today's hot idea is tomorrow's idea gone bust. After the bust, the angry client is likely to come back and say, \"Hey, I'm getting ready to retire - I really only wanted you to protect what I have, or (more accurately) what I used to have.\"\n\r\nThe inexperienced stockbroker becomes defensive, and says that it's not at all what the client initially said: \"You told me to make you money.\" This type of exchange, unfortunately, is all too common, and it gives the financial planning business a bad reputation. One of the CFA Institute's missions is to improve the public perception of the investment industry. It has adopted this Standard to reduce the misunderstandings that have often characterized the client-manager relationship in the past.\n\r\nOf course, it's entirely appropriate for some folks to ask to \"play the market\" and invest aggressively, and adopt strategies that could pay off huge if, for example, interest rates fall precipitously, or the price of a commodity such as oil increases to a far greater degree than what was expected. Many people are eager to take chances with an account - especially if they are already wealthy and have an additional base of savings, so the potential of a huge loss of principal is no big deal in the big picture. However, for some others, it might be their primary nest egg, and they might be nearing the point when they wish to retire. They may say to a financial consultant, \"make me money\", since they read about how the market has made millionaires out of average folks just like them. But it's the role of the financial professional to provide a reality check and to cover what is possible and what is not likely and/or excessively risky.\n\r\nThis Standard has several objectives :\n\n1. Learn about Your Client - Everyone is different, with a unique array of circumstances, tolerances and objectives. We cannot approach the client-consultant relationship with the notion that one basic investment strategy is appropriate for everyone. To make a reasonable inquiry means that, starting when the client relationship is being established and before actual investments are made, we first gather the necessary information and ask the necessary questions. It is the responsibility of the consultant to develop such an inquiry; however, questions such as \"What does this client require in terms of annual income?\" or \"What is this client's tolerance for risk?\" should be answered easily as a result of this process. This requirement also recognizes that client circumstances invariably change. Learning about your client is not a one-time deal; it's an ongoing exercise. Specific language in the Standard has made this ongoing exercise an ethical requirement.\n\n2. Choose What Is Suitable for Your Client - This objective ties together the formal inquiry into client circumstances with what is actually done in the client's account. For example, an investment advisor might develop a client survey to help discover client objectives and tolerances, but then stick those surveys in some remote filing cabinet and simply give everyone the same portfolio. Fulfilling the purpose of this Standard requires that the actual investments chosen and strategy employed are consistent with the information gathered.\n\r\nThis suitability consideration applies to the total portfolio, not to the individual securities. For example, selling call options is a potentially risky strategy if the underlying stock rallies. However, a covered call strategy, where the underlying stock is already owned when writing calls, mitigates this risk and can serve to enhance income in a stagnant market. An exam question might test whether puts and calls are suitable for a conservative investor - some people will guess \"no\", but the actual answer is that they may be, depending on the total portfolio.\n\n3.Educate Your Client on the Basics - Now that we've learned about our client and have chosen a suitable strategy based on that information, it's time to present what we're going to do. The most basic principle when rendering this explanation is to distinguish between fact and opinion. For example, if a Treasury note pays a 5% coupon, it's a fact that buying a $10,000 face value will net an annual income of $500. However, if a mutual fund has returned 12% annually for the past 10 years, it's an opinion that the same fund will continue to return 12%.\n\n4. Educate Your Client on the Details - After we cover the basics (e.g. what is fact and what is opinion), the client should be given a summation of the entire process. Are stocks selected based on fundamentals or on quantitative methods? Are changes in strategy made by one person or by a committee? Every detail isn't absolutely required - but in general, the more we practice full disclosure, the better.\n\nApplying Standard III-C\r\nThe client/advisor relationship is an ongoing two-way exchange of information. Case studies that apply this Standard will likely examine whether pertinent information was properly exchanged or discussed (full disclosure).\n\nClient to Advisor: Factors in applying suitability include the following:\n\n\nAge/Time to Retirement - Generally speaking, an investment strategy should become gradually less aggressive as a client gets older, but time to retirement is also a factor - someone retiring at age 50 would be treated differently than someone who is motivated to work until age 75. Moreover, with life expectancies increasing, clients can live 30-40 years after retiring. Some of their assets must assume a long-term orientation.\n\n\nIncome Needs - Clients who are drawing meaningful monthly income from an account would probably not want all of it invested in aggressive equity funds. At the same time, an individual with a $1-million account, requiring $50,000 a year, wouldn't necessarily need an average 5% income from the portfolio. It's entirely appropriate to satisfy the withdrawal needs with a combination of current income yield and capital gains.\n\n\nTolerance for Risk - Discussions about previous bad investment experiences and how an investment loss affects a client are absolutely essential.\n\n\nTotal Net Worth - In cases where a new account is only a 5% to 10% slice of a client's larger financial picture, the approach taken by the advisor can be much different. Given the total picture, what does the client expect from this account? Current income? Aggressive speculation? On the other hand, if the account represents a substantial portion of the client's total savings, an investment plan may need to account for both short-term income and long-term growth, all within the same account.\n\n\nOther Unique Factors - For example, given the onerous effect that taxes can have on investment performance, is the degree of tax efficiency a primary consideration to this client? If tax efficiency isn't important (or a complete non-factor for tax-exempt portfolios), the resulting investment approach might change.\n\nAdvisor to Client: Appropriate disclosures include the following:\n\n\nGeneral Overview of Process - There's no specific formula on what must be covered, as clients have varying degrees of sophistication when it comes to investing, as well as varying ideas of what specifically matters to them. Even for those who care little to discuss the details, some discussion on how investment strategy is developed and the return/risk expectations of a policy is required.\n\n\nMajor Changes in Process - For example, a change might be necessitated by the growth of the organization. An advisor of small-cap accounts may see growth to the point where market liquidity (ability to move into and out of stocks) is affecting the ability to carry out a previously conceived investment process that favored micro caps (and marketed this process to clients and potential clients). If restricting investments to companies with a market capitalization of $250 million or less is now too narrow and the advisor must expand the range of investments in order to handle the increased asset base, this change in policy would be material. Perhaps the inclusion of companies with a market cap of between $250 million and $500 million is appropriate, or the inclusion of foreign-based stocks is deemed necessary. Whatever is decided, any material change in investment approach could potentially impact a client's decision to retain that manager and must be disseminated prior to implementation.\n\n\nLoss of Key Personnel - While the performance record of an investment strategy is the property of the firm, it's also a product of the work of the individual manager who led the development of the process, directed the research, made the investment decisions and so forth. A change in investment personnel can affect the client's decision to affiliate with that firm in the first place, or it can be a nonissue. Either way, the firm is obligated to provide adequate disclosure of key personnel changes. In addition, if the switch in personnel prompts a change in investment approach - for example, from an active strategy to a passive one - the manager may need to modify advisory fees accordingly. A client might be paying a premium fee for a manager's reputation or for the rigor of the research process and should not be required to pay the same premium if he or she is now going to be invested in a mix of passive index funds.\n\r\nSome examples of the application of standard III(C) follow:\n\nInvestment Suitability\r\nAn independent investment advisory was previously an account manager with a hedge fund, with which he still maintains personal and business connections. To attract new clients, the advisor offers below market management fees and provides his new clients with direct access to the hedge fund. The investment advisor puts as many of his new clients in the hedge fund as possible. Standard III(C) has been violated because the risk profile of the hedge fund may not be suitable for every client. Additionally, standard V(A) \u2013 Diligence and Reasonable Basis may also have been violated.\n\nInvestment Policy Requirements\r\nThe chief investment officer (CIO) of a large financial subsidiary wants to improve the diversification and returns of its investment portfolio. The investment policy statement for the subsidiary authorizes highly liquid investments, such as highly rated corporate or government bonds, with a five-year maturity or less. The CIO has discovered an exciting new investment in a private equity fund, which includes a three-year lock-up period but an exit option in stages after that. The CIO invests 4% in the fund, leaving the portfolio well within guidelines for overall equity exposure. The CIO violated both standard III (A) \u2013 Loyalty, Prudence and Care, as well as standard III(C).\n\r\nThe fund does not fit the requirements for highly rated, liquid investments. Additionally, the lockup period and laddered exit structure of the fund suggests the investment could last beyond the required maturity limits of no more than five years.\n\nHow to Comply\n\n\nDraft Investment Policy Statement - This is drawn from information contained on a written survey and in the client/advisor interview. The resulting policy statement should include the following ingredients:\r\n\t\t\n\nClient Identification - who they are, their age and time horizon, beneficiaries, previous investment experience\n\nClient Objectives - return expectations, needs for income and growth, tolerance for risk, need to limit downside risk potential and to preserve the initial invested capital\n\nPortfolio Constraints - current and future expected liquidity needs, regular contributions into account, regular withdrawals out of the account, tax considerations, time horizon, regulatory or legal circumstances, individual preferences and restrictions (no tobacco or gambling stocks, for example), guidance on proxy voting.\n\n\n\nPeriodic Review Process - Think of the investment policy statement as the foundation of a relationship that should be ongoing and is expected to evolve over time. An annual review will help establish the benefits of ongoing communication, help identify changing circumstances and facilitate a re-examination of the specific guidelines contained in the investment policy statement. In addition, logging all history of client contact, phone calls and emails initiated and received, issues discussed and changes made as a result will help improve the understanding of the client's unique financial circumstances.\n\n\nSuitability Tests - Regulators increasingly are requiring that firms establish suitability tests. Test procedures should be established to include an analysis of the how different investments will impact portfolio diversification, a comparison of investment risks to client risk tolerance, and a test to ensure the investment fits the investment strategy.\n\n\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_12", "text": "\n        When communicating investment performance information, Members or Candidates must make reasonable efforts to ensure the information is fair, accurate and complete.\n\nReasoning behind Standard III-D\nThis Standard applies the guiding ethical principles of fair representation and full disclosure to the measurement and presentation of investment performance information. Much of the negative stigma associated with the money management business has to do with the marketing of performance returns in an effort to capture attention (e.g. \"We returned 46% last year, and the market only did 11%! Sign up with us!\"). Prospective clients and the investing public at large don't know what to think. Are these numbers a fair indication of what they can legitimately expect or a sleight-of-hand magic trick that may or may not be a total fabrication?\n\nMisrepresenting Performance Records - Some of the Tricks\n\n\nSelective Account - Take our previous example, where the manager wishes to promote the fact that the company returned 46%. Let's assume this manager has 500 accounts, yet one and only one of them did indeed happen to return 46% because (for tax purposes) it retained a 25% stake in one stock that tripled in price last year (these things do happen - even amateur stock pickers can end up with a three or four bagger!). However, most of the accounts under his umbrella were market performers at best. The manager figures that 46% was an audited, actual performance number, and he'd prefer to promote his best work.\n\n\nSurvivorship Bias - Say this manager took similar chances in other accounts (i.e. retained a large investment position in one stock), but the results were not quite as favorable. For one group of accounts, the manager added a penny stock at $0.31 a share, thinking that $2 was a virtual lock once the firm emerged from bankruptcy. Instead, a new class of equity shares was created and the old shares became worthless. A group of accounts with this stock experienced -8% to -14% overall returns, and the clients all terminated in disgust. However, these accounts are not current accounts and the manager excluded them from any representation of performance.\n\n\nPortable Record - Say that Firm A claims to have a 10-year track record averaging 14% a year. In actuality, that 14% track record was produced by the management style of a competing firm. So that Firm A could make the claim, one of the members of the research team at the competing firm was hired away and made director of research. While this new hire did have a role in the decision-making process that produced the 14%, he was not the lead manager. In addition, in order to comply with the Standard, all decision makers within that competing firm would have had to been hired away. Due to these restrictions, in most cases, a firm will be unable to claim the same performance record as the new hire. \n\n\nSelective Time Frame - The 46% return from last year was done in an account that, for the four years prior to that year, produced an average annualized return of -19%. In other words, much of the 46% represented a mere recovery from a previous sharp decline. \n\n\nSimulated Numbers - To start a second product line, the manager engages in a lengthy exercise in data mining with his financial software, during which he discovers a screening model that, when applied to foreign small-cap stocks, appears to be capable of producing a 31% annualized performance number over a 10-year period. The marketing materials created to promote this discovery show the stellar 10-year track record but conveniently leave out the fact that these numbers are based on a simulation and not on actual invested assets.\n\nIn our earlier discussion of Standard I-C, which deals with misrepresentation, we noted the tendency for some practitioners to guarantee a future outcome based upon historical information. The tricks described above show that there are many creative ways to represent a performance outcome without actually making guarantees. In establishing Standard III-D, the CFA Institute is carrying this same caution against misrepresentation (as a general guiding principle) and applying it to the practice of developing performance information that describes the actual investment experience of a typical client.\n\nPPS-GIPS\nIn addition to the stated requirements of Standard III-D (which primarily focus on the ethics of fair representation and full disclosure), a higher purpose of the CFA Institute is to (1) facilitate comparability of performance records while (2) improving professionalism of the industry and (3) bolstering its purpose as a self-regulating body. \n\nThe CFA Institute aims to achieve these goals by applying a common standard by which all managers will calculate and present their investment performance. To help develop this common standard, it first established Performance Presentation Standards (PPS), which are applicable to North American firms. More recently it has branched out globally with the Global Investment Performance Standards (GIPS), which it hopes to implement worldwide.\n\nThe PPS and GIPS are voluntary.\r\nMembers are not required to adopt them, and a failure to do so is not a violation of Standard III-D. Members are encouraged, if not strongly encouraged, to adopt the standards. There are many worthwhile reasons to adopt the GIPS, but there are also many unique issues that make implementation more challenging for some firms (particularly smaller firms and those without sufficient records). At this time, an industry-wide requirement is seen as discrimination in favor of the big institutions, which can devote greater resources to performance-measurement issues.\n\nIn a later section, we will address the requirements of the GIPS in much greater detail. The CFA Institute is in the process of eliminating the old CFA Institute PPS, which are North American standards (the PPS is now regarded as a CVG, or a country version of the GIPS). Some firms would prefer to promote compliance with the more stringent set of standards, which is the PPS. As they are now, the PPS and GIPS are only modestly different, the main distinction being that the GIPS have relaxed the time requirement of the historical track record (PPS - 10 years, GIPS - five years) and eliminated requirements for alternative asset classes. For the CFA exam, the GIPS are the applicable standards that will be tested. \n\nApplying Standard III-D\n\n\nKnow that compliance with PPS and GIPS is voluntary, and not required to comply with Standard III-D. However, it is a violation of the Standard to claim compliance with GIPS, in a case where the firm chooses to deviate from GIPS. For example, GIPS requires all fee-paying discretionary portfolios to be included in at least one composite. If a firm holds itself out as GIPS compliant, yet it eliminates outliers in calculating composite performance (as it feels the outliers skew that data and make it less representative), then it is not fully compliant with the GIPS and it is misrepresenting itself by stating that it is. If, however, this same firm eliminates GIPS compliant from its literature, it would not be violating Standard III-D. \n\n\nA failure to disclose pertinent facts is likely to be a violation. However, including appropriate disclosures in the presentation of performance data will frequently avoid violations of this Standard. Let's return to our earlier examples of violations of Standard III-D: the issue of portability of investment results (advertising a manager's track record from a previous affiliation) is seen as misleading for the client. However, if a previous track record is displayed clearly as such (it is labeled as applying to a previous affiliation), with the appropriate disclosures intended to clarify the issue for the client, then the CFA member has complied with the intent of the Standard and would not be in violation. Likewise, simulated returns are permissible for marketing purposes but only if the appropriate disclosures are included, such as the summary of how the model was developed and the fact that the results being displayed are being applied retroactively.\n\n\nThe key words in applying this Standard can be found in its final sentence: \"fair, accurate and complete\". Determining whether a violation has occurred is sometimes a bit subjective, but by using the spirit of \"fair, accurate and complete\", you can handle situations presented on the CFA exam. \n\nHow to Comply\n\n\nAdopt the GIPS Guidelines - Or, more accurately, encourage your firm to adopt them. Doing so would be the best procedure to avoid any violations. However, full compliance with the GIPS is not absolutely required, and in the absence of full compliance, adopting certain aspects of the GIPS is likely to be beneficial.\n\n\nAdd appropriate disclosures - This can help clarify and explain what a prospective client sees (e.g. what do \"simulated\" and \"portable from a previous manager\" mean?)\n\n\nConsider the Knowledge of the Audience - Some presentations will necessitate additional explanation.\n\n\nPresent performance of Similar Portfolios - This avoids presenting a single portfolio as representative of likely results.\n\n\nMaintain records - These will clarify how performance was determined. It's wise to anticipate that full adoption of the GIPS may be the direction in which the industry is headed, and the records will help any needed conversion. \n\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_13", "text": "\n        Members and Candidates must keep information about current, former and prospective clients confidential unless:\n\n\r\n\t\tthe information concerns illegal activities on the part of the client or prospective client,\n\r\n\t\tdisclosure is required by law, or\n\r\n\t\tthe client or prospective client permits disclosure of this information.\n\nReasoning behind Standard III-E\nEstablishing a professional relationship with a client necessitates the gathering of personal information. For investment professionals, surveying a client's personal financial information is standard practice. It's a necessary prerequisite to fulfilling their jobs and establishing an investment policy statement that meets the client's risk tolerance and objectives. Of course, this discovery could reveal potentially sensitive or embarrassing issues from the past - everything from unfortunate business decisions to bankruptcy filings. Clients have an unambiguous right to privacy, as well as a right to have their personal information kept in the strictest confidence and not forwarded or revealed to a third party.\n\nStandard III-E was developed to protect these rights, starting from the time of initial contact (prospect-member relationship) and covering the time the prospect formally becomes a client (client-member relationship). In the event that sensitive information is revealed by any employer in the course of its relationship with an employee, the same concept is expanded to protect confidentiality in the employer-member relationship. \n\nNote that there are instances that would necessitate disclosure of a client's confidential information and which would not be considered violations of this Standard:\n\n\nIllegal Activities - For example, if a client is involved in illicit money-laundering activities and contributing the money to a managed account at the CFA member's institution, that portfolio manager is under no obligation to protect the client's confidentiality. In fact, knowingly continuing to invest and trade such an account might expose the portfolio manager to charges of criminal activity. If illegal activities are suspected, a firm's legal counsel must immediately be consulted on how best to proceed.\n\n\n\nLegally Required Disclosure - When the Securities and Exchange Commission requires certain client information to be disseminated, the CFA member is bound to abide by these regulations. \n\n\n\nGranted Permission by the Client or Prospective Client - An investment manager may need to forward client information to the client's accountant for tax preparation. So long as permission is granted, the CFA member is not violating the confidentiality Standard. \n\n\n\nInquiry from the CFA Institute's Professional Conduct Program (PCP) - In the words of the Handbook (pg. 127), CFA members shall consider the PCP an extension of themselves. CFA members are encouraged to be fully supportive of PCP investigations, and to disclose any information requested in the course of an investigation. The PCP keeps all disclosed information in the strictest of confidence.\n\nApplying Standard III-E\nKeeping client information confidential is essential to building and developing a relationship of trust. On the CFA exam, cases involving this Standard are likely to test the exceptions that will require disclosures to be made. \n\nHere are some examples of situations that may require disclosure of confidential information:\n\n\nSettlement Agreements - In a case where a manager and client have entered into a settlement agreement, the agreement cannot be written so as to prohibit co-operation with the CFA Institute's Professional Conduct Program (PCP) in the investigation of a CFA member (i.e. investigating whether that member violated the Code and Standards). So-called confidentiality clauses must explicitly allow both the member and the client to respond to requests for information, without restriction. Failing to provide information in a PCP investigation, even if based on a confidentiality clause, subjects the member to a summary suspension under CFA Institute bylaws, and his or her right to use the CFA charter may be revoked.\n\n\n\nCharitable Donation - A portfolio manager meets with a corporate client that can reduce its taxes by giving away money to charity and that has set aside $100,000 for this purpose. Would the portfolio manager violate Standard III-E by divulging to a local charity that the company has $100,000 to give away? In such a case, it would depend on whether the corporate client gave permission to the manager to reveal this information. If not, the manager would need to keep the information private and protect confidentiality.\n\n\n\nIllegal Activities - A portfolio manager suspects a client of illegal activity, but has no tangible evidence to support these suspicions. The portfolio manager understands her obligation to keep sensitive information confidential, but does not wish to support anything illegal. If such a case arises, doing nothing is not an option. She is best served by seeking legal counsel and informing her supervisor.\n\nHow to Comply\n\n\nProtect client information when received by not disclosing any gathered information to outside parties. \n\n\nLimit the number of employees with access to sensitive information regarding a client's financial or other activities.\n\n\nSeek legal counsel promptly if illegal activity is suspected.\n\n\nSeek legal counsel if asked to disclose confidential information as a result of an investigation, either by the CFA Institute's Professional Conduct Program or by legal authorities. Disclosure in these instances may ultimately be required but one is entitled to legal advice to determine how best to reveal this information.\n\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_14", "text": "\n        Standard IV consists of three subsections:\n\n\r\n\t\tStandard IV-A: Loyalty\n\r\n\t\tStandard IV-B: Additional Compensation Arrangements\n\r\n\t\tStandard IV-C: Responsibilities of Supervisors\n\nWhy Are CFA Charterholders recommended to inform employers on ethical standards?\nOne of the core purposes of the CFA Institute is to promote ethical awareness throughout the securities, investment research and financial management (and related) industries. While CFA Members and Candidates are obligated to follow these principles, nonmembers may not be aware of their existence and may be unwittingly breaking certain provisions of the Code and Standards. Any violation can be potentially harmful to all employees of the firm, including CFAs who would be forced to explain why their company wasn't following the same guidelines that they had pledged to follow as members of the CFA Institute. The CFA Institute hopes that by recommending to its Members and Candidates that they disseminate the Code and Standards to more senior coworkers, the ethical principles captured in the Code and Standards will be adopted as a minimum rule of conduct and will enhance ethical awareness, honesty and personal conduct throughout an organization. Many firms, large and small, have internal guidelines and expectations for their employees - the CFA Institute gives a ready roadmap that it hopes every organization will embrace. \n\nSince CFA Members and Candidates often have coworkers (with greater seniority) that are also CFA Institute members, there's often a belief that this Standard is already fulfilled since \"someone else must have taken care of it\". Instead, all Members and Candidates should take personal responsibility to investigate whether the Code and Standards are incorporated into their firm's internal compliance program.\n\nDistinction between \"Required\" and \"Recommended\"! \nFor example, one does not need to distribute the Code and Standards throughout the firm and request an RSVP from everyone. Nice idea, but it's not required. An exam situation might present a CFA member who complied with a required part but one of the answer choices might suggest he is in violation because he didn't follow through on a recommended action. That would be a wrong answer. Failing to act on required parts of Standards is a violation. Failing to act on recommended parts is not. \n\nStandard IV-A: Loyalty \n\r\nIn matters related to their employment, Members and Candidates must act for the benefit of their employer and not deprive their employer of the advantage of their skills and abilities, divulge confidential information, or otherwise cause harm to their employer.\n\nReasoning behind Standard IV-A\nIn the eyes of the CFA Institute and its membership, ethical standards involve a measure of loyalty to the person or the entity that is \"signing the paycheck\". Unlike some other practices that are commonly regarded by society as unethical (such as lying, stealing or showing up to work intoxicated), the principle of loyalty to one's employer is the subject of debate - and legitimately so, given that loyalty is not always given back in return (as anyone who's been downsized or separated surely knows). \n\nIndeed, the very wording of Standard IV-A is done under the premise that certain employees will at some point put their own interests ahead of their loyalty to the firm. Given that these situations are inevitable, the Standard seeks to guide those individuals into making principled choices that ultimately protect the interests of the employer, while at the same time reflecting well on that individual and on the profession.\n\nStandard IV-A is sometimes misunderstood, with critics pointing out that the Standard places an unfair burden on members who aren't always out to do harm to their employer. A member may merely be trying to be enterprising, or may be providing a service to a modest core of trusted clients - who all too often are loyal to that individual for what he or she can do, and are not particularly concerned with the firm with which this person is currently affiliated. With that qualifier in place, the following activities might be seen as a violation:\n\n\nMisappropriation of trade secrets- that is, taking the methods used to build a client\u00e8le at the current firm and applying the same techniques to compete for the same clients\n\nMisuse of confidential information\n\nDiscussing the new firm with numerous coworkers and offering all of them jobs at the new shop, igniting a mass resignation\n\nSoliciting the current client base for services at the new business while still employed at the old place\n\nMisappropriating client lists, property or information\n\nA breach of contract between the employer and employee (particularly if it regards provisions of a signed non-compete contract)\n\nDefinitions as They Apply to Standard IV-A\n\n\nPractice - Any service currently available (for remuneration) at the individual's firm. Thus, if a CFA member is employed at an investment advisor and is hired to write the ethics section of a CFA Level I study guide, he or she would not be violating Standard IV-A, since his or her employer does not publish CFA study guides. \n\n\nUndertaking Independent Practice - \"Actually engaged in competitive business\" should be distinguished from \"making preparations\" to begin independent practice. An individual is free to prepare for a new independent venture, as long as the preparations do not involve any of the activities listed above (and, in particular, don't actively solicit clients). As noted previously, each circumstance is unique - actions must remain consistent with the duty to be loyal to one's employer. \n\n\nActual earned and collected compensation is not necessary to violate this Standard. Many people violate the Standard but claim (as a defense) that no fees have been collected or earned. If activities could eventually result in compensation - that is, if the intent is to lay the groundwork for a new affiliation that will eventually net that person compensation - then the activities could be judged under the guidelines of this Standard.\n\nApplying Standard IV-A\n\nThe following questions should be considered when applying the Standard:\n\n\nWhat sort of relationship does the CFA Member or Candidate have with the employer, and what is the agreement under this relationship? In the investment business, a firm will retain some employees merely as independent contractors. In addition, some independent contractors have relationships with multiple firms. In these cases, the duty to loyalty is likely to be more narrowly defined than it must be for a full-time employee. What is the degree of control that a firm has over the employee?:\n\n\nHow many hours are worked and at what location?\n\nDoes the member take other independent contracting jobs or is he or she searching for full-time work?\n\nWhat is the relationship between the independent contractor and any of the firm's clients?\n\nDuties within an independent contractor's relationship are best to be specified in a carefully defined agreement (preferably written), after which the independent contractor is bound by those terms.\n\n\n\nWhat if the practice is unsolicited and benefiting a friend or neighbor? Take an example of a portfolio manager and CFA charterholder, Ben Wilson, who starts by offering his neighbor Lisa Green, who has limited experience with financial planning, free portfolio advice on a large inheritance she just received. Since Ben's advice did not result in compensation, and none was expected, there is no violation. Soon thereafter, Lisa asks Ben to take a look at the 401(k) plan of her company, which has just fired its previous money manager. Ben develops a financial plan and is compensated at a rate 20% lower than that given to the previous manager. Even with the discount, Ben must obtain written consent from two parties to continue the arrangement: his current employer and Lisa's employer. Failure to obtain written permission violates Standard IV-A.\n\n\nHas written consent been obtained? Standard IV-A provides that Members and Candidates have fully complied with their duty to their employer as long as all competing business arrangements are fairly represented and fully disclosed, in writing, to the employer, as well as to the individual or entity that the outside practice will benefit. Both the employer, and the additional outside beneficiaries of the member's work, must agree to the arrangement.\n\n\nWhat is the duty owed by a CFA Member or Candidate who is part time, an independent contractor or a college intern, and is openly seeking full-time employment elsewhere? For example, take the hypothetical case of Matt Miller, a CFA candidate who was serving as an unpaid summer intern for an institutional money manager. Matt assists the analysts in the research department by writing reports on potential stock ideas, focusing on telecommunications stocks. He also obtains access to the firm's proprietary stock-screening tools. Near the end of Matt's internship, he accepts a job as a telecom analyst for a brokerage, which he landed in part due to the work as an intern (Matt had discussed the internship in detail in the interview). Since the internship was highly educational and since the work done there can directly help him get started at the full-time job, Matt copies all of the research reports, stock screening models and related spreadsheets. Has Matt violated the Duty to Employer Standard? In this case, Matt received no monetary compensation for his efforts, but, in regard to the application of the Standard, Matt did receive benefits in terms of relevant work experience and shared knowledge with the analysts of the firm. Since he benefited, he is considered an employee - and since he is an employee, he is bound by the duty of loyalty to his employer. To fully comply with Standard IV-A, Matt will need to obtain written permission from the firm that provided the summer internship in order to use all reports and financial models created or used in the course of the internship.\n\n\nWhat About Whistle blowing? Protecting the integrity of the capital markets and individual client interests runs paramount to a member's or candidate's personal interests, or their loyalty to the firm. If an employer is engaged in illegal or unethical activities, and a member or candidate refuses to comply because it would go against what's best for the markets or clients, then violating standard IV(A) may be justified (as long as the motive is not personal gain). Members and candidates should understand their company's policies on whistle blowing and encourage the adoption of best practices.\n\nHow to Comply\n\n1. Provide a written statement describing the relationship, the type of service, the expected duration and the expected compensation.\n\n2.Do not render services until written consent from employer is received.\n\n3.Disclose to clients the identity of one's employer, clarify that it is an independent arrangement and state the fees that would apply under a similar contract with the employer.\n\n4.Do not render services until client reads and understands these disclosures and provides written consent.\n\nFinal Note: Doesn't This Standard Seem Unfair?\nFollowing Standard IV-A can, in some cases, truly test even the most ethical CFA member, as it can require balancing competing interests and motivations and may, to some extent, place the CFA Member or Candidate at an unfair disadvantage. In other words, starting a new business practice necessitates solicitation of potential clients, and one's best prospects are likely to be contacts made in one's current business relationship. The CFA charterholder may wonder, \"These clients have enjoyed a longstanding affiliation with this firm because of me, and they are happy primarily because of me, yet I'm not allowed to solicit them for my new venture until after I resign?\" The reason for the Standard is that requiring someone to accept a bit of temporary unfairness when leaving a firm is a small price to pay for the greater good provided to the profession as a whole - namely, promoting an ethic of loyalty.\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_15", "text": "\n        Members and Candidates must not accept gifts, benefits, compensation or consideration that competes with, or might reasonably be expected to create a conflict of interest with, their employer's interest unless they obtain written consent from all parties involved.\n\nReasoning behind Standard IV-B\nAs with a number of Standards, the disclosure required by Standard IV-B is intended to uncover and prevent potential conflicts of interest - in this case, the potential conflicts that can arise with additional gifts or monetary bonuses offered to an individual in a position of trust. \n\n\nMoney Motivates - The investment business is one that draws highly intelligent, capable and motivated people. Some are drawn to the fact that the work itself can often be interesting, dynamic and challenging, while others are motivated by the opportunity to enhance the financial well-being of others by their strategies, insight and planning. At the same time, there is no question that the potential for lucrative salary, bonuses and other perks has traditionally been a primary draw for young graduates assessing potential career options and for those who have worked in other industries but are looking for another career path. \n\n\nMoney Corrupts - Thus, this is an industry populated with individuals who are often primarily motivated by money, who sell and market their services to wealthy individuals and companies who usually have plenty of excess money to spend. This Standard acknowledges that greed and money have the possibility to corrupt - that is, when we accept additional gifts and money from an outside party, it's possible that the money could either directly or indirectly affect our decision-making. Instead of acting objectively in the best interests of all clients and in the best interests of our employer, we might develop loyalty to those who provide the most expensive gifts, and even act to conceal the nature of our relationship with the gift givers. \n\n\nMoney - It's Not Always Bad - Standard IV-B does not assume that every arrangement for additional bonuses and gifts is a corrupt one. To be sure, Standard IV-B doesn't prevent someone from accepting additional gifts, benefits, bonuses and so forth - it's just that when rewards and/or compensation are accepted, the Standard obligates the CFA Member or Candidate to inform his or her employer, in writing. As with other Standards, the principles of fair representation and full disclosure are the guiding principles, as we believe that the employer is entitled to this full disclosure. It is the employer's responsibility to decide whether or not additional compensation arrangements are appropriate, and whether they affect the actions and motivations of that employee.\n\n\nDefinitions as They Apply to Standard IV-B\n\n\nCompensation - Compensation applies to direct cash payments or bonuses by the clients, as well as indirect compensation provided by third parties. It applies to non-monetary gifts, which includes complementary vacations, memberships to country clubs or health clubs, reimbursement of expenses - anything that is provided to the employee by the client and could create even the appearance of a conflict of interest.\n\n\nIn Writing - \"In writing\" means any form of communication that can be documented. Computer email is regarded as an acceptable format for disclosure, assuming that the direct supervisor has access to and uses email.\n\n\nApplying Standard IV-B\n\n\nReward for a Job Well Done - Violations of Standard IV-B will often develop quite innocently, often by the actions of a wealthy client who is simply making a friendly gesture. Take a case where a well-to-do retired couple has vacation property. They regard their investment advisor as a close friend and wish to show off the property, but they also want to give the advisor some incentive (i.e. if he outperforms the market in their portfolio, they offer him to take a week's vacation at their expense). Accepting this arrangement would be a violation unless the analyst discloses the offer in writing to his or her employer.\n\n\nLimit the Gifts - Analysts sometimes will attend an industry conference where the sponsor will give complementary giveaways to attendees, such as pens and notepads, coffee mugs and book bags. Generally speaking, such items are considered nominal and wouldn't fall under the scope of this Standard, even though they are gifts. However, suppose a technology company presents at a conference, and then gives away a free notebook computer and printer to an influential analyst, hoping for a favorable recommendation. Standard IV-B would prohibit such activity unless the employer was notified. Generally speaking, one should avoid even the appearance of impropriety by declining any gifts. Complementary items such as pens and book bags are not seen as a violation, though one should recognize that the Standards have evolved so as to limit the acceptance of free gifts.\n\n\nHow to Comply\n\n1. CFA members must report all arrangements for additional monetary compensation to their immediate supervisor, preferably prior to the acceptance of the gift, but immediately thereafter otherwise.\n\n2. Written reports should include the specific terms, including the duration of the agreement, specific amounts that could be potentially earned and the nature of non-monetary benefits.\n\n3. Review all existing internal compliance procedures relating to compensation from clients and business associates and the potential for conflicts. For example, outside business partners have traditionally paid for travel and other expenses in order to entice an employee to visit, but in recent years many firms have acted to strictly limit this practice. Discuss these issues with the compliance officer and understand what is and is not acceptable for that firm.\n\n4. Follow all instructions made as a result of the disclosure. An employer may decide that a compensation arrangement is not appropriate, and if so, an employee is bound to follow that decision.\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_16", "text": "\n        Members and Candidates must make reasonable efforts to detect and prevent violations of applicable laws, rules, regulations, and the Code and Standards by anyone subject to their supervision or authority.\n\nReasoning behind Standard IV-C\r\nAn ethical violation reflects not only on the conduct of that employee, but on the ability (or inability) of that person's supervisor to control or influence this conduct in an ethical manner. In a number of situations, a violation of some law, rule or regulation takes place purely due to the fact that the employee who was guilty of the conduct did not know any better and was not adequately guided by the supervisor. In other words, this employee would've likely not made the violation had he or she been fully aware that it was a violation.\n\r\nSupervisors can play a crucial role in terms of taking the authority and responsibility to positively influence the behavior and conduct of those below them on the company chart. If a supervisor is a CFA Member or Candidate, this Standard takes this responsibility a step further and requires those with supervisory responsibilities to take specific preventative actions in the course of guiding the conduct of others.\n\nKey Points to Remember about Standard IV-C\n\r\n1.The responsibility to guide employee conduct in an ethical manner is that of the CFA Member or Candidate who assumes that supervisory role, and the Standard holds whether or not the supervised employees are CFA Institute members, CFA charterholders or candidates in the CFA program. The Code and Standards are not something that we as CFA charterholders follow but don't expect others to abide by; rather, they are a minimum standard to which we hold ourselves and which we wish to spread to those around us. Standard IV-C uses the authority we have to impress these ideals on others, even if these people are not specifically bound by the Code and Standards.\n\r\n2.\"Reasonable supervision\" is determined by the situation, typically as a function of the number of employees supervised and the specific jobs being done. For example, an individual who oversees a large equity-trading operation with hundreds of employees will need to pay particular attention to procedure, given the large number of employees and the scrutiny (and potential for insider dealings and other malfeasance) found when trading securities. A person in this role cannot possibly keep track of every individual every minute of the day, which is why a supervisor is permitted to rely upon reasonable procedures. By contrast, someone who supervises just one person, or a handful of people, is likely to be capable of personally evaluating every individual's conduct, and if the jobs are of a less sensitive nature (e.g. administrative help around the office), where violations are simply less likely to occur, then the reasonable procedures and controls on which one can rely may be relatively simple and straightforward. Each case will have its unique procedures.\n\r\n3.In cases where a law, rule or regulation is violated, it does not necessarily indicate that the supervisor violated Standard IV-C. However, when rules are broken, it is likely that the rules and procedures will be scrutinized, and it could mean that established rules are inadequate.\n\r\n4.Merely enacting procedures does not necessarily discharge a supervisor of a potential violation of this Standard. For example, if a supervisor assembles a compliance manual just to satisfy the regulators, but then looks the other way while subordinates plagiarize or engage in insider trading, we would say that the supervisor's controls were insufficient for the case and he or she violated the Standard.\n\r\n5.If a Member or Candidate finds a compliance system to be inadequate and prone to violations, but is unable to take corrective action, he or she must decline supervisory responsibility, in writing, until improved procedures are enacted. Members and Candidates are responsible for themselves and for subordinates on the company chart, and they are not permitted to ignore this Standard simply because \"That's the way they did things there\".\n\nApplying Standard IV-C\n\n\r\n\t\tTake extra care when designing procedures that could be misconstrued as a conflict of interest. As has been outlined previously, the mere appearance of impropriety must be addressed with increased sensitivity. For example, if a supervisor is charged with upholding securities laws at a brokerage, and he or she is compensated based on trading volume, it is possible that he or she could be accused of not adequately investigating (and potentially halting) certain trading patterns simply because doing so would decrease his or her compensation\n\n\r\n\t\tIt is the supervisor's responsibility to ensure that investment recommendations, reports and other products of a research effort are fully compliant with the Code and Standards. For example, when a supervisor passes along a report without an adequate review and that report contains misstatements, is plagiarized or uses material nonpublic information (or violates any other Standard), it is a violation for both the supervisor and the employee - particularly if the report is the basis for investment action.\n\n\r\n\t\tA violation under a supervisor's watch isn't a violation per se, but the subsequent process for handling a potential violation can by itself violate Standard IV-C. As an example, if a subordinate employee is suspected of unfair dealings that may favor wealthy clients, and the supervisor brings the matter to the attention of the employee, the supervisor may not be doing enough by simply taking the employee's testimony that \"it won't happen again\". Even reporting the violation up the chain of command is not likely to be enough. So long as the matter is under investigation, additional actions must be taken (e.g. extra monitoring, limiting that employee's activities, suspending certain responsibilities) as a preferred course of action.\n\nHow to Comply\n\r\nQuestions regarding procedure on the exam may test Standard IV-C. If it comes up, remember two simple questions that will help in designing an effective compliance program:\n\r\n1.Which violations in particular are most likely to occur?\n\r\n2.What rules will best uncover and prevent these violations?\n\r\nDesignating a compliance officer, as well as making a compliance manual available to the organization are effective methods in ensuring the organization has a system of checks and balances. There should be an educational program in place, which continually updates personnel on compliance procedures.\n        \n        \n            \n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_17", "text": "\n        Standard V has three subsections:\n\n\r\n\t\tStandard V-A: Diligence and Reasonable Basis\n\r\n\t\tStandard V-B: Communication with Clients and Prospective Clients\n\r\n\t\tStandard V-C: Record Retention\n\nStandard V-A: Diligence and Reasonable Basis_____________ \n\nMembers and Candidates must:\n\n1. Exercise diligence, independence and thoroughness in analyzing investments, making investment recommendations and taking investment actions. \n\n2. Have a reasonable and adequate basis, supported by appropriate research and investigation, for any investment analysis, recommendation or action.\n\nReasoning behind Standard V-A\r\nIt's an all\u2013too-common practice for a participant in the investment industry to pass a \"hot stock tip\" onto clients. While some professional practitioners will research and investigate such ideas before recommending them to clients, many others simply pass along that information as a way of keeping in contact with clients who have a high net worth and prompting additional trading action (on which the broker collects commissions). For the creators of the Standards of Professional Conduct of the CFA Institute, Standard V-A, Diligence and Reasonable Basis, is designed to reduce and eliminate such practices. Moreover, and partly as a result of the Standards promoted by the CFA Institute and other regulatory bodies, the investing process is much more highly developed today when compared to the Standards from years ago. The specific techniques and methods developed to practice investment research have been encouraging to those who believe that such analysis leads to better recommendations and better performance for clients.\n\r\nTo be sure, hot stock tips still have their proponents and practitioners \u2013 just watch any cable channel devoted to financial and business news. For most of us, there's some intrigue to playing \"buy, sell or hold\" on one of these programs and asking a leading analyst for a 30-second soundbite on a company. The internet chat rooms that provide a forum for discussion among day traders will continue to proliferate, and in the case of some sectors (usually small caps and IPOs, usually technology), these forums can offer immediate ideas for a portfolio manager. The basic premise of this Standard is that the market has always been filled with ideas that can be acted upon immediately. An idea is not the same as a recommendation \u2013 it takes a process to go from idea to recommendation.\n\r\nThis Standard recognizes that many investment professionals are not directly involved in the investment process. Perhaps they are primarily involved in the client relationship effort, and within that client relationship, specific portfolio transactions are recommended.\n\r\nTo avoid a violation, professionals' recommendations should be based on:\r\n\n\r\n\t\ttheir own firm's research\n\r\n\t\tanother person's research, where conclusions are based on research complying with this Standard (diligence, thoroughness)\n\r\n\t\tresearch prepared for general distribution by a bank or brokerage\n\r\n\t\tquantitative methods, such as computer stock screens or ranking models based on fundamental criteria\n\nKey Points to Remember about Standard V-A\n\n\nExercise diligence in investigating the accuracy of a research report being used as the basis for a recommendation. The market is filled with worthwhile research and with substandard research \u2013 years of experience are needed to learn to distinguish between the two. Quantitative conclusions are usually predicated on the quality of the data and the size of the sample, while fundamental research will vary depending on the methodology of the individual writing the report.\n\n\nFor recommendations to buy or sell foreign securities, consider the differences between foreign and domestic standards. Particularly in emerging markets, the extent of corporate disclosure can be minimal, and accounting standards are often rudimentary, with typical ratios such as debt level and net profit margin being difficult to compare to an industry peer in a domestic market. Moreover, securities regulations do not serve to protect the investor to the same extent as in mature markets. Liquidity can be sparse, and currency fluctuations can affect performance.\n\nApplying Standard V-A\n\n\nBe sensitive to business considerations. If the need to diligently research and gather information to investigate a company conflicts with an ongoing business relationship with that firm, an analyst may need to balance those conflicting responsibilities, and (if necessary) point out where necessary information could not be obtained.\n\n\nIs the research using a best-case scenario in a business situation as if it were the average or expected scenario? This is a common technique to justify a buy recommendation, but it essentially violates the misrepresentation tenet of the Standard. Research is considered higher quality when it presents a range of possible scenarios.\n\n\nRecommendations disseminated in internet chat rooms or on cable TV shout-fests are not considered compliant with this Standard. CFA charterholders are not precluded from participating in such forums, but the nature of this Standard is to require diligence and thoroughness and to require records to be created and retained. Moreover, it is difficult to fact-check this information to verify misrepresentations.\n\nHow to Comply\r\nTo summarize, the following areas should be the primary focus:\r\n\n\nThe Security - Each research process is likely to be unique, but whatever the particular basis for a specific recommendation might be, it should generally be consistently applied to the company's history of recommendations. Many research shops employ a general template of information that is always to be included with a recommendation (e.g. a summary of specific business factors, important financial statistics and ratios) to help guide compliance and ensure that the analyst employs a consistently diligent effort.\n\n\nThe Portfolio - Is this security (and its expected level of risk) appropriate for all portfolios, or is it too risky for some, or perhaps not aggressive enough for others? CFA charterholders and candidates are obligated to examine the needs and circumstances of the clients on an ongoing basis, not just when the account opens. Portfolio theory emphasizes the need to diversify as a tool for reducing risk; thus any approach that concentrates a portfolio in just a couple of investments may not be in compliance.\n\n\nThe Records - The importance of maintaining a complete track record of reasons for investment decisions is reinforced by the need to make this requirement a separate Standard in the revised list that becomes effective in 2006 (please refer to Standard V\u2013C). Files can establish a paper trail and help protect the manager from accusations that a certain security (should it turn out badly) was not bought with an adequate basis and rationale.\n\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_18", "text": "\n        Members and Candidates must:\n\nStandard V-B: Communication with Clients and Prospective Clients\n\r\nMembers and Candidates must:\n\r\n1.

Use reasonable judgment in identifying which factors are important to their investment analyses, recommendations or actions, and include those factors in communications with clients and prospective clients.\n\r\n3. Distinguish between fact and opinion in the presentation of investment analysis and recommendations.\n\nReasoning behind Standard V-B\r\nThis Standard establishes guidelines for one specific product of an analyst: the research report that is prepared for public dissemination, rather than being tailored for use by a particular individual's account. Of course, some analysts write reports for a particular individual account or fund, and these guidelines apply in these cases as well. However, Standard V-B was drafted with the idea that many reports are researched and distributed by banks, full-service brokers and research boutiques, among other entities. Traditionally, these types of entities employ a staff of analysts that will be assigned a certain industry or sector and be required to write a buy, sell or hold recommendation on a number of the companies in the sector and maintain a watch list over the entire group.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLook Out!\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\tThe term \"research report\", as it applies to this Standard, is very broad and covers much more than the traditional research reports as defined above.\n\r\n\t\t\t\tFor example, any form of communication can potentially apply, including (but not limited to):\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tface-to-face recommendation\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tspeech or panel discussion\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttelephone conversation\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTV appearance\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinternet webcast or blog\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nFor example, any form of communication can potentially apply, including (but not limited to):\r\n\n\r\n\t\tface-to-face recommendation\n\r\n\t\tspeech or panel discussion\n\r\n\t\ttelephone conversation\n\r\n\t\tTV appearance\n\r\n\t\tinternet webcast or blog\n\r\nBecause many reports are packaged as soundbites or recommended lists, the Standard provides for an inclusion of the caveat that additional information is available upon request. In other words, it is not a violation to publish a recommended list with a quick sentence or two on a large list of companies, provided the analyst implemented a diligent and thorough process to arrive at that buy or sell conclusion on the security, and his or her company can provide more detail to those who are interested.\n\r\nA number of research methodologies are more quantitative or technical in nature \u2013 for example, the analyst may employ a technique that takes short positions from a list of stocks that are trading within 5% of their 52-week high prices, have reached a technically overbought condition based on the shape of their price charts and have experienced a reduction in institutionally based trading volume over the last month. These reports and techniques are fully compliant with this Standard, provided they are supported by reference material and the applied methodology is consistent with previous recommendations.\n\nApplying Standard V-B\r\nHere are some questions to consider when applying this Standard:\r\n\n\nAre opinions and projections separated from factual information?\r\n\t\tWhen presented with a hypothetical situation on the exam, start by asking this question. If the CFA exam addresses Standard V-B in a question, the most likely reason for a violation will be that the author of the research report either presented his or her own opinions as factual information, or else was not clear to differentiate between data that represented actual results and that which represented projections. Quantitative methods can be particularly confusing in this regard \u2013 for example, many methodologies assemble a statistical fair price for a security, which is then used in such a careless manner that it appears to represent the actual price of the security.\n\n\nIn the gathering of information on a company, has this information been reviewed for accuracy by a representative of that company?\r\n\t\tSuch techniques are perfectly legitimate \u2013 after all, acquiring and reviewing a company's most recent 10-K is usually a good initial step to discover more about that firm. However, a company's internal projections of its own revenue and earning potential may be excessively optimistic or misleading. A fundamental research report should include those areas of greatest importance in the mind of the analyst, not the data most relevant to the public-relations specialists at the company.\n\n\nHas a newsletter or watch list omitted too much relevant information?\r\n\t\tThe Standard indicates that it is the prerogative of the author of the research to use reasonable judgment when presenting a report and deciding which factors to include and exclude. However, there are cases where the resulting package will fail to cover pertinent information related to technique. For example, a complex analytical system may produce a monthly list of recommended mutual funds within a 401(k) plan and a second list of funds to reduce or sell. If a manager's reputation was built on managing and trading accounts within that plan based on a correlation model, it would be a violation of Standard V-B to simply list the five to seven highest-rated funds in a newsletter without including any information on the underlying methodology and techniques for allocating the funds into a portfolio. Focusing purely on recommendations is a likely violation without any appropriate caveats.\n\n\nHas a research report adequately outlined the risk factors, or failed to analyze less optimistic scenarios?\r\n\t\tThe CFA Program tends to place a great deal of emphasis on analyzing risk and protecting the investing public from downside risk as a result of the actions of its members. A derivative or synthesized product, for example, may be excessively risky in periods of rising interest rates, and if a research report recommending the security simply assumes that interest rates will fall, the report is in violation of this Standard.\n\n\nDoes a research report omit the analyst's real reason for making a specific recommendation?\r\n\t\tFor example, Wall Street observers in recent years have coined the term \"whisper number\" to refer to a quarterly earnings-per-share (EPS) result or quarterly revenue number that some analysts (if not a consensus of analysts) believe is most likely for the firm in question. However, since none of the leading experts covering a stock are prone to updating EPS projections, the public consensus estimate for quarterly earnings remains the same. If an analyst chooses to upgrade a company recommendation based on the rising whisper numbers (or reduces the stock to a hold because the whisper numbers are plummeting), the research report outlining the reason for change needs to address the relevant factors, as required by this Standard.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLook Out!\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe CFA exam is usually very topical in presenting its ethical situations to candidates, and the quality (or lack of quality) in Wall Street-produced research has been a primary point of discussion in recent years, especially following the bear market earlier in this decade. Debacles involving firms such as Enron and Worldcom uncovered the fact that the leading analysts were little more than cheerleaders for the main companies they cover, arousing concern. Why is virtually every leading stock reported as a buy or a strong buy? The Standards relating to research reports may be of particular importance to the CFA examiners in this climate.\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nHow to Comply\r\n\t\tEach subsection of this Standard relates to a specific goal that needs to be addressed when preparing research reports for public distribution:\r\n\t\t\u00a0\n\nUsing Reasonable Judgment on Factors to Include/Exclude - This procedure is in many ways the most subjective requirement within this Standard, as it is largely a function of an analyst's experience in preparing research reports and understanding what factors are of greatest importance to readers and users of the research. A specific checklist is not relevant to a standard of conduct where each case needs to be individually evaluated. As with the other Standards guiding the investment process, one would start by archiving all records relating to the report, so that conclusions can be explained and additional information can be supplied upon request.\n\n\nDistinguishing between Facts and Opinions - This goal avoids the most obvious violations of the Standard, but given that most reports use facts as the basis for investment opinions (i.e. all reports will have both), it's important to make such distinctions in as clear a manner as possible. Moreover, any data presented as fact must be properly scrutinized for reliability and accuracy. Financial databases that cover hundreds of data points for thousands of companies may produce misleading data \u2013 for example, they may show a negative price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio on a cyclical company, which then draws down the average P/E of a portfolio. In such a case, an analyst must ensure that the data presented is processed in a manner that provides for such situations.\n\n\nIndicate Basic Characteristics - This goal in particular provides some indication of the degree of risk that an investor will assume. A star system (1 through 5 stars, with 5 being safest) or a letter grade (\"A\" being the safest) will accomplish the task in the least amount of space. Other summary reports specify low, medium, high or very high risk. These labels are often an invaluable guide to determine whether the research should be used.\n\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_19", "text": "\n        Members and Candidates must develop and maintain appropriate records to support their investment analysis, recommendations, actions and other investment-related communications with clients and prospective clients.\n\nReasoning behind Standard V-C\r\nThis Standard was created starting with the 9th edition, taking effect in 2006. Previously, recordkeeping was mentioned in the discussion on Reasonable Basis (Standard V-A), but it has now developed to the point where a separate Standard is being written in order to reinforce its importance. In developing appropriate relationships with clients, keeping records is an exercise in \"covering your tail\" by substantiating, via a formal and defined recordkeeping process, why all investment decisions were made and are being made.\n\nKey Points to Remember about Standard V-C\n\n\r\n\t\tRecordkeeping procedures are the responsibility of the firm, with the individual required to assist in retaining research notes or other documents. Specific responsibilities will vary based on the role of that individual in the investment decision-making process.\n\n\r\n\t\tRecords may be maintained either in hard copy or in electronic form.\n\n\r\n\t\tCFA Institute recommends retaining records for seven (7) years, in the absence of any local guidance or regulation.\n\n\r\n\t\tRecords created as part of the Member or Candidate's professional activity are the property of the Firm, NOT the individual. Thus it is an ethical violation for a member to take such property with him/her to a new affiliation, without the express written consent of the firm.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLook Out!\n\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\tThe concept that records are the \"property of the firm, not the individual\" might be tested in the case of a quantitative model. In other words, can the developer take these records (how the model was developed) to a new affiliation? Keep in mind \u2013 it's the firm's model, not the individual's model. The developer would need to completely re-create his or her work at the new affiliation to avoid a violation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_20", "text": "\n        Standard VI contains three subsections:\n\n\r\n\t\tStandard VI-A: Disclosure of Conflicts\n\r\n\t\tStandard VI-B: Priority of Transactions\n\r\n\t\tStandard VI-C: Referral Fees\n\nStandard VI-A: Disclosure of Conflicts\n\r\nMembers and Candidates must make full and fair disclosure of all matters that could reasonably be expected to impair their independence and objectivity or interfere with respective duties to their clients, prospective clients and employer. Members and Candidates must ensure that such disclosures are prominent, are delivered in plain language, and communicate the relevant information effectively.\n\nReasoning behind Standard VI-A\r\nAs with the other Standards under Category IV, the primary intent of this Standard is to protect the employer. Full disclosure is a standard that is met with some resistance by those who wish to protect their privacy, but the principle recognizes the greater good that results from required disclosures.\n\r\nBy extension, disclosing conflicts of interest protects clients and the public - indeed in Standard IV-B this same principle is revisited as it relates to relationships with clients and prospects. Devoting two separate Standards to the guideline shows that conflicts of interest are of vital concern to the investment industry, as they potentially impact the final three words of the Code of Ethics: \"independent professional judgment\". In the view of the CFA Institute, a beneficial ownership in stock of a company could potentially lead to bias in favor of that security, especially in larger firms where an influential portfolio manager can often move the market in favor of his or her personal holdings simply by recommending their purchase for client accounts or for a mutual fund he or she is managing.\n\r\nConflict of interest guidelines crafted by compliance departments often seem excessive from the outside looking in, but these rule are more important than ever in today's environment, where the mere appearance of a conflict can be the basis for a lawsuit. Legal guidance tends to be risk averse and works toward rules and regulations that aren't likely to be challenged by a court of law. There's little to be gained by arguing that \"you are ethical and won't be unbiased\" - these rules are crafted to provide a legal foundation so that everyone is subject to the same guidelines, and thus, faithful adherence to these rules must be followed.\n\r\nWith regard to personal ownership of securities, note that the first part of this Standard simply requires disclosure to the employer of all securities owned. Based on this disclosure, and based on the activities of the firm, the company may issue additional restrictions that may limit personal trading in certain securities. The second part of the Standard states that for any internal directive that is imposed, the employee is fully obligated to honor what the employer is requiring. In other words, it is not simply breaking a company rule; it is also violating the Code and Standards and an individual would be liable to sanctions from both his or her firm's compliance department and the CFA Institute's Professional Standards and Policy Committee.\n\r\nIf the CFA Level 1 Exam presents a conflict of interest situation, it's usually worthwhile to pick out the choice that seems the most excessive in terms of disclosure and communication. Ignoring or failing to report something is almost certainly the wrong way to go!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLook Out!\n\n\n\n\nCurrent versus Revised: Standards relating to Conflicts of Interest have been grouped together under their own Roman numeral (VI, Conflicts of Interest) for the first time - an indication of their importance to the profession. Traditionally, Standards have been organized in relation to the affected entity (Employer, Customer, Investing Public), but conflict of interest issues tend to affect all of these relationships.\n\n\n\n\nApplying Standard VI-A\r\nHere are some problematic situations to be aware of when you are tested on this Standard on the exam:\n\n\nThe fact that a transaction is small and insignificant isn't a valid excuse for violating this Standard. An exam question might describe a situation in which an analyst bought only 10 shares of a stock that was on a company's restricted list, and tell you that he bought it for his 10-year-old daughter's college fund (exam situations often try to mask violations by making them seem innocent), but these details do not matter. Yes, buying 10 shares of a stock for a child's account has no material effect on one's ability to be unbiased. However, one must strictly adhere to the conflict of interest rules as they are established not only to prevent material conflicts, but also to avoid the appearance of a conflict, and to establish the legal foundation that these rules are universally enforced.\n\n\n\nDon't leave a decision on whether to report something to the discretion of the individual. When in doubt, report the relationships or the purchased securities to the compliance officer or other appropriate person, and allow the employer the chance to determine whether a conflict of interest exists in a particular situation.\n\n\n\nImmediate family members are generally subject to the same disclosure rules. If you come across a question dealing with this subject on the exam, don't answer that a person was not required to report a material position in a company simply because the stock was registered in his wife's name. That would be wrong.\n\n\n\nDisclose \"quid pro quo\" business relationships. For example, the Standards of Practice Handbook (pg. 54) gives the example of an advisor who was using a small broker/dealer for trades, even though that broker/dealer wasn't giving competitive prices - the relationship existed because the advisor was receiving referrals in return (a quid pro quo) and the broker/dealer was an old college friend. This scenario shows a failure to act in the client's best interests and is a violation of the Standard governing conflict of interest.\n\n\n\nAn analyst is also a board director. Here's a summary of possible conflicts:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDirector \n\n\nAnalyst\n\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\tDuty owed to shareholders\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\tFiduciary duty to clients\n\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\tSecurities or options received as compensation\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\tRecommendation will bid share price higher\n\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\tPrivy to material nonpublic information\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\tUsing material nonpublic information?\n\n\n\n\n\nA small investment advisory firm is bought by a larger firm. The new relationship must be disclosed on any recommendations of the larger firm's securities.\n\n\n\nThere's a change in the bonus incentive. A firm changes the way it compensates its portfolio managers, switching to an incentive plan where more of the emphasis is on short-term (one-year) performance numbers (relative outperformance). Earlier, the primary incentive was trailing five-year numbers. The new incentive represents a material change in how accounts are handled and must be disclosed to clients.\n\n\n\nAn analyst puts out some favorable research. An analyst has options that will expire worthless unless the underlying stock price can rally in the next couple of months. The analyst writes up a buy recommendation on the stock to help ignite a rally. Is this action a violation? While the situation presents an obvious conflict of interest, the analyst is free to make such a recommendation, provided that (a) there is a reasonable and adequate basis and (b) there is disclosure of the ownership in the options and the fact that they are expiring.\n\r\nOn exam day, when you're presented with a situation and asked to evaluate whether it is truly a conflict of interest, ask whether that information seems material. Would a reasonable person view it as creating a potential bias? The Standard requires that you err on the side of caution - what seems trivial to one person (e.g. \"I once worked at a broker/dealer, and 10 years ago we participated in an underwriting for preferred shares in this firm.\") might mean quite a bit to another.\n\nHow to Comply\n\n\r\n\t\tReport beneficial interest in any security that could reasonably be considered to interfere with the individual responsibility to render unbiased opinions in one's day-to-day work.\n\r\n\t\tReport all such securities owned by one's immediate family, and any accounts (e.g. family trusts) over which one has investment discretion.\n\r\n\t\tReport all transactions for self and families.\n\r\n\t\tReport all outside relationships that might give the appearance of a conflict (e.g. board memberships, trustee positions).\n\r\n\t\tObey all internal directives of a firm.\n\r\n\t\tDiscuss conflict of interest questions with the compliance officer and the immediate supervisor (or legal counsel, if appropriate) prior to taking any action.\n\nCase Study\r\nIf a research analyst's wife serves on the board of directors of a company and the analyst writes a research report recommending purchase in those shares, such a relationship might create a particular bias in favor of that company and those shares. A client might read the research report and say, \"Well, of course this guy likes the stock - his wife serves on the board of directors. He's probably just recommending it to support her.\" The client might view the wife's seat on the board as a factor that makes unbiased and objective reporting impossible. Even if the research is thorough, complete and fully supported, it's those material relationships - which create a conflict of interest in the eyes of some - that must be fully represented and fairly disclosed to the client pondering whether to act on the recommendation. To not disclose such information is regarded as unfair to the client and an ethical violation.\n\nMaterial Relationships\r\nStandard VI-A was created to address situations where there are material relationships associated with companies that are also the subject of research reports and investment recommendations. The sole requirement associated with this Standard is disclosure of the relationship - what sort of potential conflict does this person have? The disclosure should be made in plain language, in such a way that the essential information is conveyed to the client, who needs to know.\n\r\nFor the case study above, placing the disclosure \"An immediate family member sits on the board of directors\" on the first page of the report would put the analyst in compliance with the Standard. Disclosing that it's the analyst's wife might carry even more meaning, but the analyst also has a right to privacy and \"immediate family member\" is all that is required by the Standard.\n\r\nThe Standard applies most particularly to situations where an analyst recommends the stock and also retains a personal investment position in the shares. Some people might view this type of conflict in a positive light - as \"the analyst likes it enough to own it\". Important relationships that require disclosure include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n\r\n\t\tMaterial beneficial ownership of securities (self or immediate family)\n\r\n\t\tUnderwriting relationships between the company and the analyst's firm\n\r\n\t\tBroker/dealer relationships (e.g. whether this broker makes a market in the stock)\n\r\n\t\tBoard of directors, retained as a consultant, etc.\n\r\n\t\tImmediate family circumstances (e.g. spouse employed there)\n\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_21", "text": "\nInvestment transactions for clients and employers must have priority over investment transactions in which a Member or Candidate is the beneficial owner.\n\nReasoning behind Standard VI-B\nThis Standard addresses the personal investing of those in the investment profession and establishes that there must be a certain hierarchy of interests in order to maintain the public trust: first client and employer interests, then personal interests. The underlying principles of the Standard are directed to those individuals who are in a position to have acquired advance knowledge of pending activity by their employer. Lacking any standards or guidance, these individuals are likely to consider their own self-interest and trade for themselves ahead of any pending activity. In some cases (e.g. a small, independent advisor), the impact of this pending activity is probably negligible. In other cases (e.g. a major Wall Street brokerage changes a recommendation), such announcements can be a significant factor in driving the price of the security. \n\nIn either case, front running transactions is considered unethical behavior - and not necessarily because of any potential positive or negative impact on the stock. Front running is prohibited because of the importance of the duty of loyalty that investment professionals owe to their clients, and the fact that this duty is compromised whenever professionals place their personal interests before those of their clients.\n\nThe issue of personal investing continues to be debated by the members of the CFA Institute. Many have suggested that the most sensible way to resolve the issue - and address the public's perception that self-interest guides the behavior of investment professionals - is to prohibit all personal investing by active practitioners. Such a ban would eliminate the need to scrutinize everyone's personal activities for potential conflicts of interest. At the same time, such an extreme measure would likely prompt many talented individuals to leave the investment business and would discourage others from ever entering, which would hurt the average investor in a broader sense. \n\nSo, as it stands today, investment personnel are not completely banned from personal investing. However, the CFA Institute has adopted a series of recommended guidelines, including a ban on participation in IPOs and strict limits on acquiring securities in private placements. While these are not yet required, they are designed to address areas of conflict and reinforce a culture that will restrain blind self-interest in these matters.\n\nPersonal transactions include any activity in the following:\n\n\nA member's own account\n\nAccounts of family members, including spouse and children (and this includes personal transactions \"hidden\" in an account carrying one's wife's maiden name)\n\nDirect or indirect pecuniary interest - which might include trust or retirement accounts\n\nApplying Standard VI-B\nThe intent of this Standard on priority of transactions is to ensure fairness and avoid conflicts of interest. When you encounter these situations in an exam question, start by asking whether a standard of fairness has been applied. Allowing preferential treatment for oneself or one's family members is obviously a violation, but less obvious are situations where the Standard has been misinterpreted or excessively applied. The following are some of the more common situations that test whether the Standard has been violated: \n\n\nInitiating or Changing a Recommendation - In a case where an analyst wishes to change a recommendation on a security, it is a violation of this Standard to withhold the change until a personal transaction is completed. To be in compliance, the analyst would need to first announce the change and then allow time for the information to be disseminated, and only then could he or she act on his or her personal behalf in an account regarded as a personal account. If an analyst wishes to recommend a stock but temporarily withholds the idea so he or she can buy for a personal account, he or she will be in violation of Standard VI-B because he or she will be attempting to personally benefit from information or knowledge he or she acquired, rather than practice a duty of loyalty and permit clients to benefit first.\n\n\n\nFamily Account at a Disadvantage - Take a situation where an analyst has access to an IPO and private placement shares from time to time. His parents' retirement account and the college trust funds of his three nieces and two nephews are under the custody of his firm and are under his full discretion to manage. This analyst is familiar with the CFA Code and Standards and is concerned about showing any favoritism in accounts where he believes he might be perceived as having an indirect pecuniary interest. Therefore, when IPO shares are available for him to allocate, he excludes his personal accounts, as well as those of his parents and other relatives, and distributes those shares on a systematic pro rata basis to all other portfolios. Only when remaining shares are available does he include any relatives' accounts. In this case, even though the analyst may have been trying to do the right thing, he has misinterpreted the Standard and violated it. He has a fiduciary duty to manage in the best interests of all accounts, including those of his parents, nieces and nephews, and they are entitled to the same treatment as all other accounts, since they are also fee-paying clients of his firm.\n\n\n\nBoss's Account - A portfolio manager is given occasional access to IPO shares. Following her firm's allocation guidelines, she distributes hot IPOs based on a random draw of those accounts that have shown interest. Not every account is able to participate every time, given the relatively modest number of IPO shares available to her. However, as a rule, she always includes her boss's account (which she also manages). This account does not meet the definition of beneficial ownership as established by Standard VI-B, and she has no direct or indirect pecuniary interest. However, she has misinterpreted the Standard and is in violation. The intent of the Standards is to remove any degree of favoritism and ensure that all clients are treated fairly. Her boss was given automatic priority ahead of other accounts - moreover, even without a pecuniary interest, the portfolio manager has a vested interest in having this account perform well.\n\n\n\nInstitutional Buying - The relationship between the research and trading functions of a large organization is often tested for proper conduct. Has the firm established a blackout/restricted period between the announcement of a new or changed recommendation and the execution of trade orders? Keep in mind that while Standard VI-B does not specifically require a blackout period, it includes the language \"adequate opportunity to act on the recommendation\" to encourage firms to establish such guidelines. If an exam question presents a case in which a trader acted immediately on a recommendation (within minutes, for example, or any time that same day), that action is likely to be judged a violation as clients were not given a proper chance to react. \n\nHow to Comply\nThe following issues and ideas should be addressed when considering Standard VI-B:\n\n\nWhat Is a Beneficial Owner? Beyond the minimum definition provided by the Standard, sensitive circumstances may call for stricter guidelines.\n\nWhat Is an Investment? The Standard (and situations addressing the Standard) tends to focus on stocks, bonds and derivative securities, but if a firm invests in real estate, collectibles or currency (for example), it would need to regulate those transactions.\n\nImplement Firewalls - A firewall is designed to protect sensitive information by preventing its dissemination from one group to another. A large, diverse organization needs to adopt firewalls in certain cases - for example, between trading and research, to prevent a violation of front running prior to disclosing a recommendation. \n\nLimit Access to Persons - The more people there are with access to sensitive information, the more likely it is that information will leak out. By limiting the number of people who have access to material nonpublic information, information can be protected and violations minimized.\n\nBe Clear about Prohibited Transactions - Given the scope of a firm and its particular obligations to clients, it may choose to restrict trading in certain securities. For example, a restricted list may be compiled that prohibits trading in companies that have engaged that firm in a business relationship (perhaps as an underwriter). The CFA Institute has recommended (but not absolutely required) that participation in equity IPOs be restricted for a firm's employees in favor of client needs. Some firms have adopted those guidelines. Whatever is prohibited or restricted needs to be clearly communicated to all employees to ensure compliance.\n\nUse Blackout/Restricted Periods - As there are so many unique factors, the guiding principle should involve what is best for clients. For example, at a large firm, a total ban on trading for two business days following the dissemination of a new or changed recommendation may be the most appropriate course of action. For small firms, the guidelines may allow trades at any point following the completion of client trades. \n\nReport Personal Transactions - Typically, employees should report all transactions on a quarterly basis, though individuals with particularly sensitive responsibilities may need to report more frequently. Sending duplicate copies of confirmations and statements to the internal compliance officer is a worthwhile exercise, as it allows timelier discovery of inappropriate activity.\n\nEnforce Prior Clearance of Personal Transactions - A process that requires pre-approval of personal transactions is a good way to prevent a violation from occurring in the first place.\n\nDisgorge Trades Made in Violation - While procedures should be designed to prevent violations, it is also worthwhile to establish guidelines on how to proceed when violations occur. When a trade is made in violation of company policy, a request can be made to break the trade as soon as possible, completely reversing the transaction, with any resulting profits distributed in some manner that does not benefit the individual or the firm.\n\nEstablish Disciplinary Procedures - Establish a process for internal investigations, and determine how compliance procedures will be enforced. \n\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_22", "text": "\nMembers and Candidates must disclose to their employer, clients and prospective clients, as appropriate, any compensation, consideration or benefit received from, or paid to, others for the recommendation of products or services.\n\nReasoning behind Standard VI-C\nThe business world is built on relationships. While many of the CFA Institute's Standards address relationships between firms and clients, important business relationships can also sprout up between two or more professional firms that can deliver complementary products and services to the client. In building a client base, many practitioners have found that it is often most worthwhile to specialize in one particular discipline and gain extensive knowledge of that practice, hopefully in an effort to gain a favorable reputation and add new customers based on positive feedback from existing satisfied clients. \n\nCase Study \nFor example, an insurance broker is likely to spend a majority of her business day marketing a brand new array of insurance products and services to potential clients, educating herself on industry trends and new methods of developing business, and providing services and answering the ongoing inquiries of clients. Next door, a CPA partnership prepares tax returns and audits financial records for small businesses. Across the street is a small broker/dealer equipped to open accounts and trade an array of securities, including stocks, bonds and mutual fund securities. However, this practitioner is largely sales oriented and enjoys spending afternoons at the golf course with heavy-hitter clients; he acknowledges that he may not have the time or inclination to perform stock market research, make investment recommendations to clients and use economic forecasting to allocate between asset classes in a manner that minimizes risk. But this broker went to college with a more studious classmate, a CFA charterholder who obtained these credentials while still in graduate school. She is a leading portfolio manager at a small community bank about a mile away from the office of the broker. The broker wants to help her get better established and also broaden what he can do for his own clients. Thus, he enters into an agreement with the bank, where he agrees to refer clients requiring portfolio management services to his old college friend, in exchange for a modest fee computed by a percentage of the account at the time it opens. The portfolio manager at the bank, grateful for the inflow of business, enters a similar agreement to refer day traders to her friend at the brokerage, given that his firm offers far lower commissions than the bank. She agrees to accept a modest commission for each client referred in this manner. In time, the neighborhood's CPA firm and the insurance broker gain confidence in the other financial services firms and enter similar mutually beneficial referral arrangements with the bank's portfolio manager and with the broker/dealer. Everyone wins.\n\nThe CFA Institute guides its members to state the nature of these types of referral arrangements, given that the practice can make the partners in such arrangements partial to each other for reasons of self-interest. Returning to the case of the bank/broker arrangement, let's suppose a competing full-service broker sets up shop in the same general area. The broker offers a wide array of products and services, with a professional staff available to answer questions between 7am and 7pm every business day. The office has two CFA candidates and three others with industry experience, and the fees to the client are competitive. However, the full-service broker, as a matter of policy, will not engage in a formal referral arrangement with the portfolio manager at the bank, given that the two firms offer some of the same services and are thus competitors. However, the portfolio manager knows that this new broker dealer is a high-quality outfit, particularly when compared to her golfer friend who seems more interested in maintaining his existing client base than in maintaining the level of service the portfolio manager believes clients deserve. At the same time, she does receive that ongoing commission for referrals, which has turned into a nice second income (her bank doesn't pay her what she's worth).\n\nUnder Standard VI-C, the portfolio manager, as a CFA member and charterholder, must disclose this referral arrangement, both to the clients she receives from her broker friend and to the clients she is referring to him. If the portfolio manager practices fair representation and full disclosure, the client can make an informed decision as to whether a conflict of interest is present.\n\nApplying Standard VI-C\nHere are two other points to keep in mind when applying this Standard:\n\n\nCreative Referral Arrangements - The concept of a referral fee extends to any beneficial consideration between two parties, including so-called soft-dollar agreements between broker and advisor, where the advisor receives benefits such as research reports or software and databases that archive financial information in exchange for directing trades to the broker. Such arrangements must be disclosed to clients.\n\n\n\nOral versus Written - A financial planner informs a prospect, referred to her by a CPA firm, that she pays the CPAs a flat $1,000 (out of her pocket) for the referral. However, she only mentions this information over the phone, preferring not to mention it in the contract. Standard VI-C holds that an ethic of fairness is owed to the clients. Many people don't always recall every detail mentioned to them over the phone. In this case, the planner would be in violation unless written language disclosing the $1,000 was included in the contract.\n\nHow to Comply\n\n\nSpecify All Monetary Consideration, Both Given and Received - This disclosure must be in clear language - for example: \"I receive a flat commission equal to 0.75% of your account value.\" Specify whether fees are deducted from the client's personal account, and explain to the client if a referral fee is included as an additional hidden fee within the trading commissions.\n\nProvide Written Disclosure - Fee arrangements should be included as a part of the contract that is written and signed by both parties.\n\nInform Supervisor and Compliance Officer - Let both parties know about any proposed new referral arrangement, and seek legal counsel if clarification is necessary.\n\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_23", "text": "\nThere are two subsections under this final standard:\n\n\nStandard VII-A: Conduct as Members and Candidates in the CFA Program\n\nStandard VII-B: Reference to CFA Institute, the CFA designation, and the CFA Program\n\nStandard VII-A: Conduct as Members and Candidates in the CFA Program\n\nMembers and Candidates must not engage in any conduct that compromises the reputation or integrity of CFA Institute or the CFA designation, or the integrity, validity or security of the CFA examinations.\n\nReasoning behind Standard VII-A\nThis Standard specifically addresses the integrity or validity of the CFA examination process. Obviously, cheating on the exam in any manner is an act of moral turpitude, but the integrity of the CFA exams is of such great importance to the profession and to the members of the CFA Institute that misconduct in this area is of particular importance. CFA members are proud of their accomplishment and want to protect the examination process to ensure that the CFA charter is awarded based on merit.\n\nApplying Standard VII-A\nAll of the following activities would be considered a violation of Standard VII-A:\n\n\nCheating on the CFA examination\n\nCheating on any examination\n\nNot following the CFA exam administration rules\n\nProviding confidential exam information to candidates or to the public\n\nCircumventing (or attempting to circumvent) security measures designed to protect the integrity of the CFA exams\n\nThis Standard does not prevent the free expression of opinions (i.e. criticism) regarding the CFA Institute or the CFA examination process.\n\nStandard VII-B: Reference to CFA Institute, the CFA Designation and the CFA Program\n\nWhen referring to CFA Institute, CFA Institute membership, the CFA designation or candidacy in the CFA Program, Members and Candidates must not misrepresent or exaggerate the meaning or implications of membership in CFA Institute, holding the CFA designation, or candidacy in the CFA Program.\n\nReasoning behind Standard VII-B\nThis Standard exists primarily to promote and protect the CFA as a unique brand name. It reinforces the principle that the CFA charter represents a significant high-level achievement to those who are able to successfully navigate the program. It recognizes that the Chartered Financial Analyst designation has tremendous value with regard to enhancing one's professional credentials and resume; therefore, it requires the CFA charterholders to not cheapen what they have achieved by promoting the designation in a certain way. \n\nSome specific dos and don'ts are offered to guide CFA candidates when studying the proper application of Standard VII-B, though it's one of those guidelines that is open to some interpretation. It's difficult to say just what constitutes a less than \"proper\" or \"dignified\" or \"judicious\" use of the words \"Chartered Financial Analyst\". What might seem like good, honest, straightforward self-promotion and enterprising behavior to one person might come across as tacky and undignified in the eyes of another. Some of these words have changed in the revised Standards.\n\nThe Level I exam is likely to test you on the basics - i.e. what a person definitely can or cannot do with the CFA designation. At Levels II and III, where explanations need to be written out in essay form, a candidate will have room to interpret and examine both sides of a less-than-obvious violation. \n\nRequirements\nStandard VII-B allows for an accurate explanation of the requirements that have been met to be a CFA Institute member or a CFA charterholder, though the Standard does not actually describe what those requirements might be. \n\nWhy not? In our opinion, this is done to give some additional flexibility to the CFA Institute; that is, if it wished to change the requirements, then it wouldn't need to change Standard VII-B. For example, there have been initiatives in recent years to require all CFA members, as a condition of continued active membership, to fulfill an annual CE (continuing education) requirement, which members might fulfill in a number of ways (e.g. attending a seminar, reading material, participating in a webcast). The proposed initiative was voted down in its most recent form, though it may eventually be adopted in some other form in the future (we should note that a CE program is in place, but participation is not mandatory for members). \n\nAccording to Standards in effect January 2006, the right to use the Chartered Financial Analyst designation is granted to those satisfying the following requirements:\n\n1.Successful completion of the CFA Program\n\n2.Ongoing commitment to the CFA Institute's Professional Conduct Program. The key part of this program is that, every year, all CFA members are required to sign a Professional Conduct Statement and return it to the CFA Institute. On the Statement, the member must disclose all ethical violations or else state (and attest to the fact with a signature) that he or she has had no such violations.\n\n3.Maintenance of active membership in the CFA Institute. Annual dues are required to keep one's membership active. \n\nIn other words, even for those who have completed the rigorous CFA Program, any failure to pay annual dues or sign the annual Professional Conduct Statement (which is usually done when paying dues) results in the suspension of the right to use the CFA designation. \n\nSuspension means that it is an ethical violation (of Standard VII-B) to hold oneself out as a CFA charterholder:\n\n1.The designation \"CFA\", or \"CFA Charterholder\", or \"Chartered Financial Analyst\" must be removed from business cards, brochures or any published material, and may not be used on a resume.\n\n2.Any stated reference to oneself as a current, active or practicing CFA charterholder must be avoided.\n\n3.The actual CFA charter may not be displayed in an office or work environment.\n\nAt Level I of the CFA Program, expect the exam questions to emphasize the guidelines that cover CFA candidates. Those sitting for the Level I exam are generally new to the CFA Program, and they will be candidates for a minimum of three years. In other words, while any part of any Standard is fair game on the exam, the guidelines from the third section of this Standard might be an area of focus. In particular, you should know these two important rules:\n\n4.There is no partial designation for successfully completing any level of the CFA Program. One may merely state, \"I have completed Level I of the CFA Program\", but until all three levels are completed, one is considered a candidate.\n\n5.To be regarded as an active candidate, one must be currently enrolled with the intention of sitting for the next scheduled exam. It is a violation to sign-up once, then sign-up again 20 years later, and continue to refer to oneself as a CFA candidate.\n\nApplying Standard VII-B\nFirst and foremost, know the correct and incorrect uses of the Chartered Financial Analyst designation. \n\nThe CFA Institute has published a \"Guide for CFA\u00ae Charterholders online:\n\n\n\n\nWeblink 1.5\nGuide for CFA\u00ae Charterholders\n\n\n\n\nThe following is a brief summary of the points within CFA Institute's online guide, along with our own tips to remember for your upcoming exam:\n\na) \"CFA\" and \"Chartered Financial Analyst\" are to be used as adjectives, not as nouns or common names. In other words, it's improper to say, \"I am one of three CFAs in our research department\", or, \"Today's speaker is a Chartered Financial Analyst\". It's proper to say, \"I am one of three CFA charterholders in the research department\", or, \"Today's speaker has earned the right to use the Chartered Financial Analyst designation\". Yes, this involves using more words; it doesn't seem logical; no one does it that way; you've heard people use CFA as a noun ... we understand! But on the exam, you'll be expected to pick out examples of where \"CFA\" is being used as a noun. If you know that it's improper, you'll score easy points.\n\nb) Always capitalize \"CFA\", and don't use periods after \"C\", \"F\" and \"A\". It's \"Sam Jones, CFA\", not \"Sam Jones, cfa\", or \"Sam Jones, C.F.A.\"\n\nc) Don't create new words and phrases. There's no such thing as a Canadian CFA or a CFA style of managing money. A firm's research process doesn't employ Chartered Financial Analysis. \n\nd) The designation cannot be used as a part of a firm's name. \"Acme Chartered Financial Analysts, LLC\" is a violation.\n\ne) In writing, the designation should not appear larger than other text or bolded. We can't display \"Brian Spears, CFA\" on business cards. The font needs to be consistent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLook Out!\n\n\n\n\nCandidates: Do Not indicate an expected completion date. Stating a date would be tempting to do on a job resume (e.g. \"CFA Charter expected to be awarded in 2007\"). This is often done when showing degrees in progress - i.e. resumes for MBA students typically show the expected completion date. However, the CFA is not a degree. It is proper to state when a given level was completed (e.g. \"Level I completed in 2005\"). \n\n\n\n\nOther questions may arise when considering whether real-life situations violate Standard VII-B:\n\n1.Can a firm promote the fact that one of its employees has been awarded the CFA designation? To be consistent with the Standard, we would say that it's permissible to do so, but only if it's limited to the facts and covering the requirements - i.e. that the CFA Program requires three six-hour exams, taken over a minimum period of three years, covering topics ranging from ethics to economics to asset valuation to portfolio management. Describing membership in a local society or in the CFA Institute follows similar guidelines - i.e. it requires a basic description of the requirements to be members of those organizations. Anything that appears outlandish or shamelessly self-promoting is likely a violation.\n\n2. Can a firm promote the fact that an employee passed the three exams on the first try? This line of promotion would exceed permissible guidelines and be a violation of the Standard. Just as there is no partial designation for candidates at Level II or III, there is no super designation for those passing all exams the first time.\n\n3. Can advertising imply that CFA charterholders will help achieve superior investment results? No. This is a violation of the Standard and considered excessive and inappropriate.\n\n4. If a CFA charterholder resigns his or her position, does he or she retain the right to use the CFA designation? For these situations, look to see whether the individual in question has paid annual dues and filed a Personal Conduct Statement. If so, he or she is a CFA charterholder in good standing. However, a failure to meet these requirements means that a member is inactive, and if the CFA designation is being used on business cards or on a resume, or in conversations with clients, potential clients or other professional colleagues, it is a violation. Active membership is suspended when dues are not paid, but it can be reinstated so long as the individual resumes requirements of active membership (pays dues and files the Personal Conduct Statement).\n\n5. Are retired CFA charterholders (who no longer pay CFA Institute dues) not permitted to make any reference to their CFA accomplishment? A firm could honor a retired member and state the year in which he or she was awarded the CFA charter, as it is a dignified statement of fact and does not imply that the retired member is active and practicing.\n\nHow to Comply\nMany of these procedures were touched on earlier, but to summarize:\n\n\nFor business cards, directory listings, company letterhead and any correspondence, use the mark \"CFA\" or the words \"Chartered Financial Analyst\", separated by a comma after the individual's name and in the same font type and size as the name.\n\n\nAll explanations, descriptions, promotions, advertisements, presentations or information regarding the Chartered Financial Analyst Program - what it is and who received it - should describe concisely the requirements to obtain the right to use the CFA designation and describe concisely the CFA Institute. \n\n\nThe right to use the designation is suspended when annual dues are not paid and the Professional Conduct Statement (PCS) is not filed. Under inactive or suspended status, individuals can no longer use the designation after their names or refer to themselves as a holder of the CFA designation. However, it is permissible for inactive members to state the year in which the CFA designation was awarded and the years in which status was active (i.e. the years in which they paid dues and submitted a PCS).\n\n\nCFA candidates can properly state, \"I am a Level I (or II or III) candidate in the CFA Program.\" However, to make this declaration, they must be enrolled to take the next scheduled exam. If they are not currently enrolled, they should state, \"I passed Level I (or II or III) of the CFA Program in the year ____.\" Alluding to an expected completion date is not permitted.\n\n\nInform legal, compliance, public relations and marketing departments, in writing, on the scope of this Standard and provide examples of permitted conduct and examples of violations. \r\n\t\t\u00a0\n\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_24", "text": "\n        To be exhaustive, we will now examine the requirements of an LOS that has since been removed, on the rules of procedure for proceedings related to professional conduct. Note that it is unlikely the CFA Institute will draw exam problems from the material set forth in this section. If you are pressed for time, feel free to skip this section.\n\r\nIn practice, few - if any - CFA exam problems are likely to be drawn from this material. There are only a certain number of problems that can be devoted to Ethics and Professional Standards, and there's a much higher priority to test the details of each Standard (i.e. the material we've already covered). In preparing for Ethics, spend your time focusing on the Standards and the situations in which these Standards are tested. We present a brief summary of the Rules of Procedure primarily to be exhaustive in our coverage of every Learning Outcome indicated in the Study Guide. Don't get too bogged down in this material - it is included by the CFA Institute primarily as a warning.\n\nDisciplining CFA Members\r\nDisciplinary cases involving CFA members are handled by the CFA Institute's Professional Standards and Policy Committee, or PSPC. The PSPC has the authority to conduct investigations and impose sanctions. The PSPC has formed two subcommittees:\n\n1. Disciplinary Review Subcommittee (DRS)\r\nResponsible for:\n\r\na. Enforcing the Code and Standards\n\r\nb. Reviewing (and changing, if necessary) the Rules of Procedure\n\r\nc. Reviewing disciplinary matters\n\r\nd. Reviewing summary suspensions\n\n2. Standards and Policy Subcommittee (SPS)\r\nResponsible for:\n\r\na. Reviewing (and changing, if necessary) the Code and Standards\n\r\nb. Promoting the Code and Standards\n\r\nc. Revising published material related to the Code and Standards (Standards of Practice Handbook, self-administered ethics exams)\n\r\nd. Reviewing the annual PCS (Professional Conduct Statement)\n\r\ne. Assisting in any investigations\n\nGrounds for Discipline\r\nCFA Institute members may be investigated based on:\n\r\n1. Violation of the CFA Institute Articles of Incorporation, Bylaws, Code of Ethics, Standards of Professional Conduct, or Rules of Procedure or other applicable rules\n\r\n2. Sanction or injunction imposed by a government or judicial agency, or public or private self-regulatory organization with jurisdiction over investment-related activities\n\r\n3. Conviction of a felony, or (if the jurisdiction does not define a felony) any crime punishable by more than one year in prison\n\r\n4. Ban or restriction (permanently or indefinitely) from registration under a jurisdiction's securities laws, or any restriction related to any investment-related professional activity\n\r\n5. Failure to complete, sign and return the Professional Conduct Statement\n\r\n6. Falsifying information on a candidate or society membership application\n\r\n7. Failure to cooperate with the CFA Institute's inquiry and investigation into one's own conduct, or into the conduct of another member\n\r\n8. Any other good cause\n\nSanctions\r\nThe PSPC is authorized to impose any of the following sanctions in a disciplinary matter (in ascending order from the least severe to the most severe):\n\n1. Private Censure - The member is promptly notified and a public announcement of the censure is made in a CFA-Institute-issued publication circulated to members. However, the member's name and any specific identifying information are withheld from the announcement.\n\n2. Public Censure - A public announcement may be made in a CFA-Institute-issued publication, and the announcement may identify the person being sanctioned. Notice of a public censure may also be delivered to the member's governing regulatory body and member society.\n\n3. Timed Suspension of Membership - In addition to the public notification guidelines required of public censures, the member is suspended from membership in the CFA Institute and its affiliated societies, for a specified period of time. However, he or she may continue to use the CFA designation in professional matters. Timed suspension of the right to use the CFA designation is the same as #3, except the use of the CFA designation is also revoked, but only for a timed period, after which this right may be reinstated.\n\n4. Revocation of Membership - With this sanction, in addition to all of the public notices imposed in less-severe penalties, the member is barred permanently from membership in the CFA Institute or affiliated societies, though the right to use the CFA designation is not necessarily included in this permanent ban.\n\n5. Revocation of Right to Use the CFA Designation - This sanction is the most severe penalty that can be imposed on a CFA charterholder: a lifetime ban on using the CFA designation.\n\n6. Summary Suspension - This involves the automatic removal of membership in the CFA Institute, affiliated organizations or member societies, of the right to use the CFA designation and of the right to participate in the CFA Program.\n\n7. Suspension or Revocation from Further Participation in the CFA Professional Designation Study and Examination Program - This sanction covers CFA candidates, barring them either temporarily or permanently from the CFA Program (i.e. sitting for any exams).\n\nNotice of Disciplinary Action\r\nAny sanction must first be communicated to the affected person, summarizing the following:\n\n\r\n\t\tThe nature of the matter and a summary of the disciplinary proceeding\n\r\n\t\tWhich applicable Code, Standard or rule was violated\n\r\n\t\tOther appropriate information determined by the PSPC\n\nInvestigations\r\nInvestigations into potential violations are conducted by the designated officer appointed by the DRS, acting upon information provided by a complaining party who has filed a written complaint regarding a member's professional conduct. The identity of the complaining party will be made known to the person who is the subject of the complaint, unless the complaining party specifically requests anonymity. In this case, the designated officer will make every effort to protect the anonymity of the complaining party, though this protection may hamper the ability to gather information and establish that a violation has occurred.\n\nActions by the Designated Officer and the DRS\n\n1. Termination of Inquiry - If insufficient evidence is present to continue, the designated officer may terminate the inquiry by written notification to the member. However, the same matter may be reopened at a future date based on additional evidence.\n\n2. Private Censure - Imposed on minor violations, the recipient has the right to reject within 30 days and request a hearing. A failure to reject constitutes an admission of the charge and acceptance of the sanction.\n\n3. Stipulation Agreement - For any sanctions above private censure, the designated officer must proceed by proposing a Stipulation Agreement in writing. The member has the right to either reject and request a hearing, or accept and sign the agreement. The agreement must be signed by both parties (member and designated officer); acceptance waives any future rights to request a hearing.\n\nRequest for Hearing\r\nWhen a proposed sanction is rejected and a hearing is requested, a hearing panel of three to five members is designated by the PSPC to review the matter. In these cases, the member is entitled to the following:\n\n\r\n\t\tHearing in person - hearings may also be conducted by conference call\n\r\n\t\tScheduling of a mutually agreeable date and time within 120 days of the request, and with 30 days notice\n\r\n\t\tA reasonable opportunity to be heard in his or her own defense\n\r\n\t\tRepresentation by counsel\n\r\n\t\tPresent witnesses and evidence - all evidence and a list of witnesses must be submitted to the hearing panel at least 14 days prior to the hearing\n\r\n\t\tCross-examination of any witnesses\n\r\nThe hearing proceeds first with witnesses and evidence in support of the charge, and then with witnesses and evidence in defense of the allegations. The hearing panel deliberates privately and renders a finding of misconduct and an appropriate sanction (based on a preponderance of the evidence), or a finding that the allegations were not valid.\n\nReview of Hearing Panel Determination\r\nDisciplinary action recommended by the hearing panel shall be imposed unless a review panel determines that there are exceptional and unusual circumstances. A written request for review by a review panel may be made within 30 days. The review panel (appointed by the chair of the PSPC) consists of members who have not been previously involved in the matter and who do not have a conflict of interest. The member must detail (in writing) the exceptional and unusual circumstances, and then the review panel meets by conference call and reaches a determination. The review panel's determination is final and conclusive.\n\nSummary Suspension\r\nThis sanction removes an individual from membership in the CFA Institute, affiliate organizations and member societies. It prohibits use of the CFA designation or participation in the CFA Program.\n\r\nSummary suspensions are imposed by a designated officer of the PSPC based on one of four circumstances:\n\r\n1. The member is convicted or pleads guilty to a crime classified as a felony in the laws of the convicting jurisdiction, or (if felony is not defined) the member is guilty of a crime punishable by more than one year in prison.\n\r\n2. The member is barred permanently or indefinitely from registering under the securities laws of a government or judicial agency, or by a public or private self-regulatory organization with jurisdiction over investment-related activities.\n\r\n3. The member fails to cooperate with a designated officer's investigation into a member's conduct (either his/her own or that of another person).\n\r\n4. The member fails to complete, sign and return the annual Professional Conduct Statement.\n\r\nA summary suspension automatically becomes a revocation of membership and revocation of the right to use the CFA designation, unless the member petitions for review within five years of the date of the summary suspension. In the case of category 3 (failure to cooperate) and category 4 (failure to file annual statement), the member may object to the suspension by either cooperating with the investigation or filing the statement, or submitting a request for review within 30 days to the PSPC chair. Failure to request a review within 30 days means that the summary suspension is imposed for a minimum of one year, after which a review can be requested. A request to review a summary suspension is procedurally very similar to the review process for a sanction imposed by a designated officer (described earlier).\n\nReinstatement Following Revocation\r\nMembers may seek reinstatement of revoked privileges to be a member of the CFA Institute (or affiliated organizations and societies), to use the CFA designation or to participate in the CFA Program. The following guidelines apply:\n\n\r\n\t\tA five-year waiting period between the effective date of the revocation and the application for reinstatement\n\r\n\t\tDemonstration of fitness to practice financial analysis: to the satisfaction of the PSPC, the member must produce evidence that he or she is rehabilitated and in full compliance with any disciplinary sanctions\n\r\n\t\tAdherence to other conditions requested by the PSPC: for example, passing of a self-administered Standards of Practice examination, and filing a completed and signed Professional Conduct Statement\n\r\nPetitions for reinstatement are assigned to a designated officer of the PSPC, who conducts an investigation and renders a decision. Should a petition be denied, no subsequent petition shall be reviewed for at least two years.\n\nConfidentiality\r\nAll CFA Institute proceedings related to professional conduct are kept confidential, except if an alleged violation is a clear violation of a law, rule or regulation (in which case there is an obligation to adhere to the law), or if the member waives this right to confidentiality. A regulatory body (e.g. the SEC) has a right to request copies of certain documents, including stipulation agreements, notices of disciplinary action and decisions rendered by a hearing panel and/or review panel.\r\nTo be exhaustive, we will now examine the requirements of an LOS that has since been removed, on the rules of procedure for proceedings related to professional conduct.

In these cases, the member is entitled to the following:\n\n\r\n\t\tHearing in person - hearings may also be conducted by conference call\n\r\n\t\tScheduling of a mutually agreeable date and time within 120 days of the request, and with 30 days notice\n\r\n\t\tA reasonable opportunity to be heard in his or her own defense\n\r\n\t\tRepresentation by counsel\n\r\n\t\tPresent witnesses and evidence - all evidence and a list of witnesses must be submitted to the hearing panel at least 14 days prior to the hearing\n\r\n\t\tCross-examination of any witnesses\n\n\r\nThe hearing proceeds first with witnesses and evidence in support of the charge, and then with witnesses and evidence in defense of the allegations. The hearing panel deliberates privately and renders a finding of misconduct and an appropriate sanction (based on a preponderance of the evidence), or a finding that the allegations were not valid.\n\nReview of Hearing Panel Determination\r\nDisciplinary action recommended by the hearing panel shall be imposed unless a review panel determines that there are exceptional and unusual circumstances. A written request for review by a review panel may be made within 30 days. The review panel (appointed by the chair of the PSPC) consists of members who have not been previously involved in the matter and who do not have a conflict of interest. The member must detail (in writing) the exceptional and unusual circumstances, and then the review panel meets by conference call and reaches a determination. The review panel's determination is final and conclusive.\n\nSummary Suspension\r\nThis sanction removes an individual from membership in the CFA Institute, affiliate organizations and member societies. It prohibits use of the CFA designation or participation in the CFA Program.\n\r\nSummary suspensions are imposed by a designated officer of the PSPC based on one of four circumstances:\n\r\n1. The member is convicted or pleads guilty to a crime classified as a felony in the laws of the convicting jurisdiction, or (if felony is not defined) the member is guilty of a crime punishable by more than one year in prison.\n\r\n2. The member is barred permanently or indefinitely from registering under the securities laws of a government or judicial agency, or by a public or private self-regulatory organization with jurisdiction over investment-related activities.\n\r\n3. The member fails to cooperate with a designated officer's investigation into a member's conduct (either his/her own or that of another person).\n\r\n4. The member fails to complete, sign and return the annual Professional Conduct Statement.\n\r\nA summary suspension automatically becomes a revocation of membership and revocation of the right to use the CFA designation, unless the member petitions for review within five years of the date of the summary suspension. In the case of category 3 (failure to cooperate) and category 4 (failure to file annual statement), the member may object to the suspension by either cooperating with the investigation or filing the statement, or submitting a request for review within 30 days to the PSPC chair. Failure to request a review within 30 days means that the summary suspension is imposed for a minimum of one year, after which a review can be requested. A request to review a summary suspension is procedurally very similar to the review process for a sanction imposed by a designated officer (described earlier).\n\nReinstatement Following Revocation\r\nMembers may seek reinstatement of revoked privileges to be a member of the CFA Institute (or affiliated organizations and societies), to use the CFA designation or to participate in the CFA Program. The following guidelines apply:\n\n\r\n\t\tA five-year waiting period between the effective date of the revocation and the application for reinstatement\n\r\n\t\tDemonstration of fitness to practice financial analysis: to the satisfaction of the PSPC, the member must produce evidence that he or she is rehabilitated and in full compliance with any disciplinary sanctions\n\r\n\t\tAdherence to other conditions requested by the PSPC: for example, passing of a self-administered Standards of Practice examination, and filing a completed and signed Professional Conduct Statement\n\n\r\nPetitions for reinstatement are assigned to a designated officer of the PSPC, who conducts an investigation and renders a decision. Should a petition be denied, no subsequent petition shall be reviewed for at least two years.\n\nConfidentiality\r\nAll CFA Institute proceedings related to professional conduct are kept confidential, except if an alleged violation is a clear violation of a law, rule or regulation (in which case there is an obligation to adhere to the law), or if the member waives this right to confidentiality. A regulatory body (e.g. the SEC) has a right to request copies of certain documents, including stipulation agreements, notices of disciplinary action and decisions rendered by a hearing panel and/or review panel.\n\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_25", "text": "\n\nWhat Are GIPS? \nThere's a common expression, \"apples-to-apples\", used to describe two items that can be rightfully compared. \"Apples-to-oranges\" is used to indicate two items that really shouldn't be compared. We would not be surprised to learn that these analogies were coined by a financial planner (someone who probably enjoyed fruit), who may have been frustrated in trying to compare performance returns between investment managers. \n\nAs the industry has evolved, a number of different methodologies and approaches have developed to measure and present performance numbers. At the same time, issues have started to multiply: Time-weighted or asset-weighted? Discretionary accounts or all accounts? Before or after fees? Trade date or settlement date? Without any guiding principles, managers were essentially free to enact practices of their own choosing. \n\nDepending on those choices, real differences could result in crafting a composite performance number, and the incentive to make the best number could take priority over the most accurate. Enter GIPS. These standards apply an industry-wide approach to measure and present performance numbers, and effectively prevent the possibility of a manager presenting figures that are not fully correct.\n\nWhat Parties Do GIPS Apply To?\nThe GIPS apply directly to all firms that manage investment portfolios and that wish to market their previous track record in this practice and gather additional accounts by constructing performance composites. The development of a global standard is crucial to all firms, but particularly to those who may be in direct competition for business with foreign-based managers, to whom the same standards have not always applied. Global standards ensure that competition occurs on an equal footing and that apples-to-apples comparisons can be clearly drawn. \n\nThe Standards serve the companies that participate as they can now market their performance record and ensure immediate credibility by stating that they are GIPS compliant. However, clients and prospective clients are certainly the greatest beneficiaries to the industry-wide adoption of these Standards. Clients can now have a degree of confidence that the numbers they are using to compare managers will be representative of the actual experience of those managers and not a conveniently constructed record that may mislead or distort what actually happened. In addition, the existence of a standard helps clients and managers understand precisely how the numbers were determined. By focusing on the critical issues of how a firm achieved its performance, the client and prospective client can better understand \"methodology\" and \"process\", and be better informed - and more confident - in his or her money manager. \n\nCountry-by-Country Approach\nAs the need to facilitate comparability between investment managers has evolved, different sets of Standards were drafted and adopted for each country. Countries such as the U.S. and Canada, where the markets are highly developed and regulatory bodies play a significant role, tended to be the first to adopt performance presentation and measurement standards. The AIMR (Association for Investment Management and Research, the predecessor to the CFA Institute) has drafted several iterations of its Performance Presentation Standards, or CFA Institute-PPS, to help standardize performance measurement and presentation among firms in North America. As a result, true apples-to-apples performance comparisons can now be made for firms that claim compliance with the CFA Institute-PPS.\n\nGlobal Marketplace \nThe CFA Institute-PPS have been successful in facilitating comparability between domestic firms, but disparities between countries remained an issue. Many countries had few, if any, guidelines. As the markets worldwide have become more interdependent, the need to standardize on a global basis has become apparent. The AIMR set its sights on these worldwide disparities starting in 1995, when it sponsored the first Global Investment Performance Standards Committee to develop a single standard for the entire world. Formal endorsement of the first GIPS was made in 1999.\n\nThe Vision of GIPS\n\n1. Worldwide acceptance of one standard for the calculation and presentation of investment performance\n\n2. A format that is accepted as fair to all, and that facilitates comparability between managers that adopt the standard\n\n3.A format that provides fair representation and full disclosure, two of the core ethical principles of the CFA Institute\n\n4.Accurate and consistent investment performance data for all necessary purposes (reporting, recordkeeping, marketing, client presentations)\n\n5.Promoting fair global competition among investment management firms regardless of the market\n\n6.Limiting barriers to entry for new investment management firms\n\n7.Fostering the notion that the investment management industry can be proactive in its self-regulation initiatives while adhering to the highest ethical principles\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_26", "text": "\nWhat Are Composites?\nComposites are single groups of discretionary portfolios that collectively represent a particular investment strategy or objective.\n\nComposite Construction - Requirements\n1. Actual, fee-paying, discretionary portfolios must be included in at least one composite. Non-fee-paying discretionary accounts may be included.\n\n2. Nondiscretionary accounts must not be included in a composite.\n\n3. Composites are defined based on a common investment objective or strategy. A full definition must be made available upon request.\n\n4. New accounts are included in composites in a timely manner and one that is consistently applied, once the account comes under full discretionary management.\n\n5. Terminated accounts must be included in the historical record up to the last full measurement period in which they were under management. In other words, there is no survivorship bias where terminated accounts are eliminated.\n\n6. Accounts cannot be switched from one composite to another unless the client's objectives are documented to have changed, and the record of the portfolio remains in the appropriate composite.\n\n7. Hybrid securities (e.g. convertibles) must be treated consistently within composites.\n\n8. Carve-out segments (i.e. a single asset class that is carved out of a diversified portfolio - such as the returns on foreign stocks within a balanced account) must include a cash allocation that is consistently applied. Starting Jan 1, 2010, carve-out returns are not permitted unless the asset class is actually managed separately (with its own separate cash balance).\n\n9. Composites must only include assets under management within the defined firm.\n\n10. Simulated or model returns cannot be linked with actual performance.\n\n11. If a minimum asset level is established, no account below that value can be included, and changes to the minimum level cannot be made retroactively.\n\nComposite Construction - Recommendations\n1.Carve-out returns should be excluded unless they are actually managed separately with their own cash balance (i.e. the standard that becomes mandatory in 2010).\n\n2. To remove the effect of a significant cash flow, accounts receiving large external cash flows should use a temporary new account - in other words, place the amount of the deposit as if it were a new account but not part of the existing account. This method is an improvement versus simply excluding the account that received the deposit from composite calculations.\n\n3.Firms are discouraged from marketing a composite with a minimum asset level to a client with assets below that level.\n\nWhat is Verification?\nThe main purpose behind verification is to ensure that a firm that claims compliance with the GIPS has actually adhered faithfully to the intent of the standards. The verification process also serves to help performance-measurement teams better understand the details of the GIPS and whether all firm presentations have been consistent.\n\nVerification is another case of a standard that is recommended but not absolutely required to comply with the GIPS. If a test question indicates that a firm has not yet undergone the verification process, it does not necessarily mean it is not complaint with GIPS, and indeed, it is within its right to claim compliance should it meet all other requirements.\n\nA verification report must confirm two main issues:\n\n1. Whether a firm has complied with all firm-wide composite construction requirements.\n2. Whether processes and procedures are designed to calculate and present compliant performance results.\n\nA verification report should come from a third-party source to ensure credibility, and cover a minimum of one year.\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_27", "text": "\n1. The Firm Is Specified. In order to claim compliance with the GIPS standards, an investment management firm must define the precise entity that is claiming compliance. This definition may be the entire firm, or a subsidiary or division of a larger firm, so long as it is held out to clients and prospective clients as a distinct business entity.\n\r\nIn the context of the GIPS, a number of distinct business entities can be carved from the same corporation. To claim compliance, the distinct entity must:\n\na) be organizationally and functionally segregated from other business units and departments\n\nb) retain discretion over the assets it manages, with autonomy in the decision-making process\n\nc) have a distinct market or client type and/or use a certain investment process\n\n2. Fair Representation and full disclosure are ensured.\n\n3. All-Inclusive - Under the GIPS, firms are required to include all actual fee-paying, discretionary portfolios in at least one composite, defined according to a similar strategy and/or objective.\n\n4. Minimum History - Firms are required to show a minimum five years of performance data, or show data since inception of the firm if the firm is younger. \n\n5. Moving toward 10-Year Standard - Once five years of compliant data is achieved, a firm is required to add its annual performance for each of the next five years going forward, thus achieving a minimum 10-year track record.\n\n6. Methodology/Disclosures - Specific requirements are made by the GIPS (depending on the type of manager and the assets being managed) with respect to calculation methodology, and the required disclosures it must make. \n\n7. Integrity of Input Data - For example, composites and benchmarks must be ex ante (created before the fact), not ex post (created after the fact). \n\n8. Required Provisions - Examples are those that must be adopted to client GIPS compliance and recommended provisions that ensure best practice. Over time, expect certain recommended elements to become required.\n\n9. Additional/Supplemental Disclosures - These are often necessary, depending on the situation, in order to achieve the fair representation/full disclosure goals.\n\n10.

Lets proceed onwards to Quantitative Methods.\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_31", "text": "\nThe Quantitative Methods section of the CFA curriculum has traditionally been placed second in the sequence of study topics, following the Ethics and Professional Standards review. It's an interesting progression: the ethics discussions and case studies will invariably make most candidates feel very positive, very high-minded about the road on which they have embarked. Then, without warning, they are smacked with a smorgasbord of formulas, graphs, Greek letters, and challenging terminology. We know - it's easy to become overwhelmed. At the same time, the topics covered in this section - time value of money, performance measurement, statistics and probability basics, sampling and hypothesis testing, correlation and linear regression analysis - provide the candidate with a variety of highly essential analytical tools and are a crucial prerequisite for the subsequent material on fixed income, equities, and portfolio management. In short, mastering the material in this section will make the CFA's entire Body of Knowledge that much easier to handle. \n\nThe list of topics within Quantitative Methods may appear intimidating at first, but rest assured that one does not need a PhD in mathematics or require exceptional numerical aptitude to understand and relate to the quantitative approaches at CFA Level 1. Still, some people will tend to absorb quantitative material better than others do.\n\r\nWhat we've tried to do in this study guide is present the full list of topics in a manner that summarizes and attempts to tone down the degree of technical detail that is characteristic of academic textbooks.

A borrower who receives money today for consumption must pay back the principal plus an interest rate that compensates the lender. Interest rates are set in the marketplace and allow for equivalent relationships to be determined by forces of supply and demand. In other words, in an environment where the market-determined rate is 10%, we would say that borrowing (or lending) $1,000 today is equivalent to paying back (or receiving) $1,100 a year from now. Here it is stated another way: enough borrowers are out there who demand $1,000 today and are willing to pay back $1,100 in a year, and enough investors are out there willing to supply $1,000 now and who will require $1,100 in a year, so that market equivalence on rates is reached.\n\n\n\n\nExam Tips and Tricks\r\n\t\t\t\tThe CFA exam question authors frequently test knowledge of FV, PV and annuity cash flow streams within questions on mortgage loans or planning for college tuition or retirement savings.

Inflation makes real dollars less valuable in the future and is factored into determining the nominal interest rate (from the economics material: nominal rate = real rate + inflation rate). \n\n\nDefault-Risk Premium - What is the chance that the borrower won't make payments on time, or will be unable to pay what is owed? This component will be high or low depending on the creditworthiness of the person or entity involved.\n\n\nLiquidity Premium- Some investments are highly liquid, meaning they are easily exchanged for cash (U.S. Treasury debt, for example). Other securities are less liquid, and there may be a certain loss expected if it's an issue that trades infrequently. Holding other factors equal, a less liquid security must compensate the holder by offering a higher interest rate.\n\n\nMaturity Premium - All else being equal, a bond obligation will be more sensitive to interest rate fluctuations the longer to maturity it is.\n\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_34", "text": "\nHere we will discuss the effective annual rate, time value of money problems, PV of a perpetuity, an ordinary annuity, annuity due, a single cash flow and a series of uneven cash flows. For each, you should know how to both interpret the problem and solve the problems on your approved calculator. These concepts will cover LOS' 5.b and 5.c.\nThe Effective Annual Rate\nCFA Institute's LOS 5.b is explained within this section. We'll start by defining the terms, and then presenting the formula.\nThe stated annual rate, or quoted rate, is the interest rate on an investment if an institution were to pay interest only once a year. In practice, institutions compound interest more frequently, either quarterly, monthly, daily and even continuously. However, stating a rate for those small periods would involve quoting in small fractions and wouldn't be meaningful or allow easy comparisons to other investment vehicles; as a result, there is a need for a standard convention for quoting rates on an annual basis.\nThe effective annual yield represents the actual rate of return, reflecting all of the compounding periods during the year. The effective annual yield (or EAR) can be computed given the stated rate and the frequency of compounding. We'll discuss how to make this computation next.\n\u00a0\nFormula 2.1Effective annual rate (EAR) = (1 + Periodic interest rate)m - 1\n\t\t\tWhere: m = number of compounding periods in one year, and\n\t\t\tperiodic interest rate = (stated interest rate) / m\n\nExample: Effective Annual Rate\nSuppose we are given a stated interest rate of 9%, compounded monthly, here is what we get for EAR:\nEAR = (1 + (0.09/12))12 - 1 = (1.0075) 12 - 1 = (1.093807) - 1 = 0.093807 or 9.38%\nKeep in mind that the effective annual rate will always be higher than the stated rate if there is more than one compounding period (m > 1 in our formula), and the more frequent the compounding, the higher the EAR.\nSolving Time Value of Money Problems\nApproach these problems by first converting both the rate r and the time period N to the same units as the compounding frequency. In other words, if the problem specifies quarterly compounding (i.e. four compounding periods in a year), with time given in years and interest rate is an annual figure, start by dividing the rate by 4, and multiplying the time N by 4. Then, use the resulting r and N in the standard PV and FV formulas.\nExample: Compounding Periods\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAssume that the future value of $10,000 five years from now is at 8%, but assuming quarterly compounding, we have quarterly r = 8%/4 = 0.02, and periods N = 4*5 = 20 quarters.\nFV = PV * (1 + r)N = ($10,000)*(1.02)20 = ($10,000)*(1.485947) = $14,859.47\nAssuming monthly compounding, where r = 8%/12 = 0.0066667, and N = 12*5 = 60.\nFV = PV * (1 + r)N = ($10,000)*(1.0066667)60 = ($10,000)*(1.489846) = $14,898.46\nCompare these results to the figure we calculated earlier with annual compounding ($14,693.28) to see the benefits of additional compounding periods.\n\u00a0\nExam Tips and Tricks\n\t\t\tOn PV and FV problems, switching the time units - either by calling for quarterly or monthly compounding or by expressing time in months and the interest rate in years - is an often-used tactic to trip up test takers who are trying to go too fast. Remember to make sure the units agree for r and N, and are consistent with the frequency of compounding, prior to solving.\n\n\nPresent Value of a Perpetuity\nA perpetuity starts as an ordinary annuity (first cash flow is one period from today) but has no end and continues indefinitely with level, sequential payments. Perpetuities are more a product of the CFA world than the real world - what entity would obligate itself making to payments that will never end? However, some securities (such as preferred stocks) do come close to satisfying the assumptions of a perpetuity, and the formula for PV of a perpetuity is used as a starting point to value these types of securities.\nThe formula for the PV of a perpetuity is derived from the PV of an ordinary annuity, which at N = infinity, and assuming interest rates are positive, simplifies to:\n\u00a0\n\nFormula 2.2PV of a perpetuity = annuity payment A\n\t\t\tinterest rate r \n\n\nTherefore, a perpetuity paying $1,000 annually at an interest rate of 8% would be worth:\nPV = A/r = ($1000)/0.08 = $12,500\nFV and PV of a SINGLE SUM OF MONEY\nIf we assume an annual compounding of interest, these problems can be solved with the following formulas:\n\u00a0\nFormula 2.3(1) FV = PV * (1 + r)N(2) PV = FV * {  1  }(1 + r)N\n Where: FV = future value of a single sum of money,\n\t\t\tPV = present value of a single sum of money, R = annual interest rate,\n\t\t\tand N = number of years\n\nExample: Present Value\nAt an interest rate of 8%, we calculate that $10,000 five years from now will be:\nFV = PV * (1 + r)N = ($10,000)*(1.08)5 = ($10,000)*(1.469328)\nFV = $14,693.28\nAt an interest rate of 8%, we calculate today's value that will grow to $10,000 in five years:\nPV = FV * (1/(1 + r)N) = ($10,000)*(1/(1.08)5) = ($10,000)*(1/(1.469328))\nPV = ($10,000)*(0.680583) = $6805.83\nExample: Future Value\nAn investor wants to have $1 million when she retires in 20 years. If she can earn a 10% annual return, compounded annually, on her investments, the lump-sum amount she would need to invest today to reach her goal is closest to:\nA. $100,000\nB. $117,459\nC. $148,644\nD. $161,506\nAnswer:\nThe problem asks for a value today (PV). It provides the future sum of money (FV) = $1,000,000; an interest rate (r) = 10% or 0.1; yearly time periods (N) = 20, and it indicates annual compounding. Using the PV formula listed above, we get the following:\nPV = FV *[1/(1 + r) N] = [($1,000,000)* (1/(1.10)20)] = $1,000,000 * (1/6.7275) = $1,000,000*0.148644 = $148,644\nUsing a calculator with financial functions can save time when solving PV and FV problems. At the same time, the CFA exam is written so that financial calculators aren't required. Typical PV and FV problems will test the ability to recognize and apply concepts and avoid tricks, not the ability to use a financial calculator. The experience gained by working through more examples and problems increase your efficiency much more than a calculator.\nFV and PV of an Ordinary Annuity and an Annuity Due\nTo solve annuity problems, you must know the formulas for the future value annuity factor and the present value annuity factor.\n\u00a0\nFormula 2.4Future Value Annuity Factor = ((1 + r)n\u00a0- 1)/r\n\t\t\t\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nFormula 2.5\n\t\t\tPresent Value Annuity Factor =\u00a0(1 - (1 + r)-n /r\nWhere r = interest rate and N = number of payments\n\n\n\nFV Annuity Factor\nThe FV annuity factor formula gives the future total dollar amount of a series of $1 payments, but in problems there will likely be a periodic cash flow amount given (sometimes called the annuity amount and denoted by A). Simply multiply A by the FV annuity factor to find the future value of the annuity. Likewise for PV of an annuity: the formula listed above shows today's value of a series of $1 payments to be received in the future. To calculate the PV of an annuity, multiply the annuity amount A by the present value annuity factor.\nThe FV and PV annuity factor formulas work with an ordinary annuity, one that assumes the first cash flow is one period from now, or t = 1 if drawing a timeline. The annuity due is distinguished by a first cash flow starting immediately, or t = 0 on a timeline. Since the annuity due is basically an ordinary annuity plus a lump sum (today's cash flow), and since it can be fit to the definition of an ordinary annuity starting one year ago, we can use the ordinary annuity formulas as long as we keep track of the timing of cash flows. The guiding principle: make sure, before using the formula, that the annuity fits the definition of an ordinary annuity with the first cash flow one period away.\nExample: FV and PV of ordinary annuity and annuity due\nAn individual deposits $10,000 at the beginning of each of the next 10 years, starting today, into an account paying 9% interest compounded annually. The amount of money in the account of the end of 10 years will be closest to:\nA. $109,000\nB. $143.200\nC. $151,900\nD. $165,600\nAnswer:\nThe problem gives the annuity amount A = $10,000, the interest rate r = 0.09, and time periods N = 10. Time units are all annual (compounded annually) so there is no need to convert the units on either r or N. However, the starting today introduces a wrinkle. The annuity being described is an annuity due, not an ordinary annuity, so to use the FV annuity factor, we will need to change our perspective to fit the definition of an ordinary annuity.\nDrawing a timeline should help visualize what needs to be done:\n\nFigure 2.1: Cashflow Timeline\n\nThe definition of an ordinary annuity is a cash flow stream beginning in one period, so the annuity being described in the problem is an ordinary annuity starting last year, with 10 cash flows from t0 to t9. Using the FV annuity factor formula, we have the following:\nFV annuity factor = ((1 + r)N - 1)/r = (1.09)10 - 1)/0.09 = (1.3673636)/0.09 = 15.19293\nMultiplying this amount by the annuity amount of $10,000, we have the future value at time period 9. FV = ($10,000)*(15.19293) = $151,929. To finish the problem, we need the value at t10. To calculate, we use the future value of a lump sum, FV = PV*(1 + r)N, with N = 1, PV = the annuity value after 9 periods, r = 9.\nFV = PV*(1 + r)N = ($151,929)*(1.09) = $165,603.\nThe correct answer is \"D\".\nNotice that choice \"C\" in the problem ($151,900) agrees with the preliminary result of the value of the annuity at t = 9. It's also the result if we were to forget the distinction between ordinary annuity and annuity due, and go forth and solve the problem with the ordinary annuity formula and the given parameters. On the CFA exam, problems like this one will get plenty of takers for choice \"C\" - mostly the people trying to go too fast!!\nPV and FV of Uneven Cash Flows\nThe FV and PV annuity formulas assume level and sequential cash flows, but if a problem breaks this assumption, the annuity formulas no longer apply. To solve problems with uneven cash flows, each cash flow must be discounted back to the present (for PV problems) or compounded to a future date (for FV problems); then the sum of the present (or future) values of all cash flows is taken. In practice, particularly if there are many cash flows, this exercise is usually completed by using a spreadsheet. On the CFA exam, the ability to handle this concept may be tested with just a few future cash flows, given the time constraints.\nIt helps to set up this problem as if it were on a spreadsheet, to keep track of the cash flows and to make sure that the proper inputs are used to either discount or compound each cash flow. For example, assume that we are to receive a sequence of uneven cash flows from an annuity and we're asked for the present value of the annuity at a discount rate of 8%. Scratch out a table similar to the one below, with periods in the first column, cash flows in the second, formulas in the third column and computations in the fourth.\n\u00a0\nTime Period\nCash Flow\nPresent Value Formula\nResult of Computation\n1\n$1,000\n($1,000)/(1.08)1\n$925.93\n2\n$1,500\n($1,500)/(1.08)2\n$1,286.01\n3\n$2,000\n($2,000)/(1.08)3\n$1,587.66\n4\n$500\n($500)/(1.08)4\n$367.51\n5\n$3,000\n($3,000)/(1.08)5\n$2,041.75\n\n\nTaking the sum of the results in column 4, we have a PV = $6,208.86.\nSuppose we are required to find the future value of this same sequence of cash flows after period 5. Here's the same approach using a table with future value formulas rather than present value, as in the table above:\n\u00a0\nTime Period\nCash Flow\nFuture Value Formula\nResult of computation\n1\n$1,000\n($1,000)*(1.08)4\n$1,360.49\n2\n$1,500\n($1,500)*(1.08)3\n$1,889.57\n3\n$2,000\n($2,000)*(1.08)2\n$2,332.80\n4\n$500\n($500)*(1.08)1\n$540.00\n5\n$3,000\n($3,000)*(1.08)0\n$3,000.00\n\n\nTaking the sum of the results in column 4, we have FV (period 5) = $9,122.86.\nCheck the present value of $9,122.86, discounted at the 8% rate for five years:\nPV = ($9,122.86)/(1.08)5 = $6,208.86. In other words, the principle of equivalence applies even in examples where the cash flows are unequal.\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_35", "text": "\n\nI. MORTGAGES\nMost of the problems from the time value material are likely to ask for either PV or FV and will provide the other variables. However, on a test with hundreds of problems, the CFA exam will look for unique and creative methods to test command of the material. A problem might provide both FV and PV and then ask you to solve for an unknown variable, either the interest rate (r), the number of periods (N) or the amount of the annuity (A). In most of these cases, a quick use of freshmen-level algebra is all that's required. We'll cover two real-world applications - each was the subject of an example in the resource textbook, so either one may have a reasonable chance of ending up on an exam problem. \n\nAnnualized Growth Rates\r\nThe first application is annualized growth rates. Taking the formula for FV of a single sum of money and solving for r produces a formula that can also be viewed as the growth rate, or the rate at which that sum of money grew from PV to FV in N periods.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormula 2.6\nGrowth rate (g) = (FV/PV)1/N - 1\n\n\n\n\nFor example, if a company's earnings were $100 million five years ago, and are $200 million today, the annualized five-year growth rate could be found by:\n\ngrowth rate (g) = (FV/PV)1/N - 1 = (200,000,000/100,000,000) 1/5 - 1 = (2) 1/5 - 1 = (1.1486984) - 1 = 14.87%\n\nMonthly Mortgage Payments\r\nThe second application involves calculating monthly mortgage payments. Periodic mortgage payments fit the definition of an annuity payment (A), where PV of the annuity is equal to amount borrowed. (Note that if the loan is needed for a $300,000 home and they tell you that the down payment is $50,000, make sure to reduce the amount borrowed, or PV, to $250,000! Plenty of folks will just grab the $300,000 number and plug it into the financial calculator.) Because mortgage payments are typically made monthly with interest compounded monthly, expect to adjust the annual interest rate (r) by dividing by 12, and to multiply the time periods by 12 if the mortgage loan period is expressed in years. \n\nSince PV of an annuity = (annuity payment)*(PV annuity factor), we solve for annuity payment (A), which will be the monthly payment:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormula 2.7\nMonthly mortgage payment = (Amount of the loan)/(PV annuity factor) \n\n\n\n\nExample: Monthly Mortgage Payments\nAssuming a 30-year loan with monthly compounding (so N = 30*12 = 360 months), and a rate of 6% (so r = .06/12 = 0.005), we first calculate the PV annuity factor:\n\nPV annuity factor = (1 - (1/(1 + r)N)/r = (1 - (1/(1.005)360)/0.005 = 166.7916\n\nWith a loan of $250,000, the monthly payment in this example would be $250,000/166.7916, or $1,498.88 a month.\n\n\n\n\n\nExam Tips and Tricks\r\n\t\t\t\t\tHigher-level math functions usually don\\'t end up on the test, partly because they give an unfair advantage to those with higher-function calculators and because questions must be solved in an average of one to two minutes each at Level I. Don\\'t get bogged down with understanding natural logs or transcendental numbers. \n\n\n\n\nII. RETIREMENT SAVINGS\nSavings and retirement planning are sometimes more complicated, as there are various life-cycles stages that result in assumptions for uneven cash inflows and outflows. Problems of this nature often involve more than one computation of the basic time value formulas; thus the emphasis on drawing a timeline is sound advice, and a worthwhile habit to adopt even when solving problems that appear to be relatively simple.\n\nExample: Retirement Savings\nTo illustrate, we take a hypothetical example of a client, 35 years old, who would like to retire at age 65 (30 years from today). Her goal is to have enough in her retirement account to provide an income of $75,000 a year, starting a year after retirement or year 31, for 25 years thereafter. She had a late start on saving for retirement, with a current balance of $10,000. To catch up, she is now committed to saving $5,000 a year, with the first contribution a year from now. A single parent with two children, both of which will be attending college starting in five years, she won't be able to increase the annual $5,000 commitment until after the kids have graduated. Once the children are finished with college, she will have extra disposable income, but is worried about just how much of an increase it will take to meet her ultimate retirement goals. To help her meet this goal, estimate how much she will need to save every year, starting 10 years from now, when the kids are out of college. Assume an average annual 8% return in the retirement account.\n\nAnswer:\nTo organize and summarize this information, we will need her three cash inflows to be the equivalent of her one cash outflow.\n\n1.The money already in the account is the first inflow.\n2. The money to be saved during the next 10 years is the second inflow.\n3. The money to be saved between years 11 and 30 is the third inflow.\n4.The money to be taken as income from years 31 to 50 is the one outflow.\n\nAll amounts are given to calculate inflows 1 and 2 and the outflow. The third inflow has an unknown annuity amount that will need to be determined using the other amounts. We start by drawing a timeline and specifying that all amounts be indexed at t = 30, or her retirement day. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, calculate the three amounts for which we have all the necessary information, and index to t = 30.\n\n(inflow 1) FV (single sum) = PV *(1 + r)N = ($10,000)*(1.08)30 = $100,627\n\n(inflow 2) FV annuity factor = ((1 + r)N - 1)/r = ((1.08)10 - 1)/.08 = 14.48656\n\nWith a $5000 payment, FV (annuity) = ($5000)*(14.48656) = $72,433\n\nThis amount is what is accumulated at t = 10; we need to index it to t = 30.\n\nFV (single sum) = PV *(1 + r)N = ($72,433)*(1.08)20 = $337,606\n\n(cash PV annuity factor = (1 - (1/(1 + r)N)/r = (1 - (1/(1.08)25/0.08 = 10.674776.outflow)  \n\nWith payment of $75,000, PV (annuity) = ($75,000)*(10.674776) = $800,608.\n\nSince the three cash inflows = cash outflow, we have ($100,627) + ($337,606) + X = $800,608, or X = $362,375 at t = 30. In other words, the money she saves from years 11 through 30 will need to be equal to $362,375 in order for her to meet retirement goals. \n\nFV annuity factor = ((1 + r)N - 1)/r = ((1.08)20 - 1)/.08 = 45.76196\n\nA = FV/FV annuity factor = (362,375)/45.76196 = $7919\n\nWe find that by increasing the annual savings from $5,000 to $7,919 starting in year 11 and continuing to year 30, she will be successful in accumulating enough income for retirement.\nHow are Present Values, Future Value and Cash Flows connected?\nThe cash flow additivity principle allows us to add amounts of money together, provided they are indexed to the same period. The last example on retirement savings illustrates cash flow additivity: we were planning to accumulate a sum of money from three separate sources and we needed to determine what the total amount would be so that the accumulated sum could be compared with the client's retirement cash outflow requirement. Our example involved uneven cash flows from two separate annuity streams and one single lump sum that has already accumulated. Comparing these inputs requires each amount to be indexed first, prior to adding them together. In the last example, the annuity we were planning to accumulate in years 11 to 30 was projected to reach $362,375 by year 30. The current savings initiative of $5,000 a year projects to $72,433 by year 10. Right now, time 0, we have $10,000. In other words, we have three amounts at three different points in time. \n\nAccording to the cash flow additivity principle, these amounts could not be added together until they were either discounted back to a common date, or compounded ahead to a common date. We chose t = 30 in the example because it made the calculations the simplest, but any point in time could have been chosen. The most common date chosen to apply cash flow additivity is t = 0 (i.e. discount all expected inflows and outflows to the present time). This principle is frequently tested on the CFA exam, which is why the technique of drawing timelines and choosing an appropriate time to index has been emphasized here.\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_36", "text": "\nThis section applies the techniques and formulas first presented in the time value of money material toward real-world situations faced by financial analysts. Three topics are emphasized: (1) capital budgeting decisions, (2) performance measurement and (3) U.S. Treasury-bill yields. \n\nNet Preset Value\nNPV and IRR are two methods for making capital-budget decisions, or choosing between alternate projects and investments when the goal is to increase the value of the enterprise and maximize shareholder wealth. Defining the NPV method is simple: the present value of cash inflows minus the present value of cash outflows, which arrives at a dollar amount that is the net benefit to the organization. \n\nTo compute NPV and apply the NPV rule, the authors of the reference textbook define a five-step process to be used in solving problems:\n\n1.Identify all cash inflows and cash outflows.\n2.Determine an appropriate discount rate (r). \n3.Use the discount rate to find the present value of all cash inflows and outflows. \n4.Add together all present values. (From the section on cash flow additivity, we know that this action is appropriate since the cash flows have been indexed to t = 0.)\n5.Make a decision on the project or investment using the NPV rule: Say yes to a project if the NPV is positive; say no if NPV is negative. As a tool for choosing among alternates, the NPV rule would prefer the investment with the higher positive NPV.\n\nCompanies often use the weighted average cost of capital, or WACC, as the appropriate discount rate for capital projects. The WACC is a function of a firm's capital structure (common and preferred stock and long-term debt) and the required rates of return for these securities. CFA exam problems will either give the discount rate, or they may give a WACC.\n\nExample:\nTo illustrate, assume we are asked to use the NPV approach to choose between two projects, and our company's weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is 8%. Project A costs $7 million in upfront costs, and will generate $3 million in annual income starting three years from now and continuing for a five-year period (i.e. years 3 to 7). Project B costs $2.5 million upfront and $2 million in each of the next three years (years 1 to 3). It generates no annual income but will be sold six years from now for a sales price of $16 million.\n\nFor each project, find NPV = (PV inflows) - (PV outflows).\n\nProject A: The present value of the outflows is equal to the current cost of $7 million. The inflows can be viewed as an annuity with the first payment in three years, or an ordinary annuity at t = 2 since ordinary annuities always start the first cash flow one period away. \n\nPV annuity factor for r = .08, N = 5: (1 - (1/(1 + r)N)/r = (1 - (1/(1.08)5)/.08 = (1 - (1/(1.469328)/.08 = (1 - (1/(1.469328)/.08 = (0.319417)/.08 = 3.99271 \n\nMultiplying by the annuity payment of $3 million, the value of the inflows at t = 2 is ($3 million)*(3.99271) = $11.978 million. \n\nDiscounting back two periods, PV inflows = ($11.978)/(1.08)2 = $10.269 million.\n\nNPV (Project A) = ($10.269 million) - ($7 million) = $3.269 million.\n\nProject B: The inflow is the present value of a lump sum, the sales price in six years discounted to the present: $16 million/(1.08)6 = $10.083 million.\n\nCash outflow is the sum of the upfront cost and the discounted costs from years 1 to 3. We first solve for the costs in years 1 to 3, which fit the definition of an annuity. \n\nPV annuity factor for r = .08, N = 3: (1 - (1/(1.08)3)/.08 = (1 - (1/(1.259712)/.08 = (0.206168)/.08 = 2.577097. PV of the annuity = ($2 million)*(2.577097) = $5.154 million.\n\nPV of outflows = ($2.5 million) + ($5.154 million) = $7.654 million.\n\nNPV of Project B = ($10.083 million) - ($7.654 million) = $2.429 million.\nApplying the NPV rule, we choose Project A, which has the larger NPV: $3.269 million versus $2.429 million. \n\n\n\n\n\nExam Tips and Tricks\r\n\t\t\t\tProblems on the CFA exam are frequently set up so that it is tempting to pick a choice that seems intuitively better (i.e. by people who are guessing), but this is wrong by NPV rules. In the case we used, Project B had lower costs upfront ($2.5 million versus $7 million) with a payoff of $16 million, which is more than the combined $15 million payoff of Project A. Don\\'t rely on what feels better; use the process to make the decision!\n\n\n\n\nThe Internal Rate of Return\r\nThe IRR, or internal rate of return, is defined as the discount rate that makes NPV = 0. Like the NPV process, it starts by identifying all cash inflows and outflows. However, instead of relying on external data (i.e. a discount rate), the IRR is purely a function of the inflows and outflows of that project. The IRR rule states that projects or investments are accepted when the project's IRR exceeds a hurdle rate. Depending on the application, the hurdle rate may be defined as the weighted average cost of capital.\n\nExample:\nSuppose that a project costs $10 million today, and will provide a $15 million payoff three years from now, we use the FV of a single-sum formula and solve for r to compute the IRR. \n\nIRR = (FV/PV)1/N -1 = (15 million/10 million)1/3 - 1 = (1.5) 1/3 - 1 = (1.1447) - 1 = 0.1447, or 14.47%\n\nIn this case, as long as our hurdle rate is less than 14.47%, we green light the project.\nNPV vs. IRR\nEach of the two rules used for making capital-budgeting decisions has its strengths and weaknesses. The NPV rule chooses a project in terms of net dollars or net financial impact on the company, so it can be easier to use when allocating capital. \n\nHowever, it requires an assumed discount rate, and also assumes that this percentage rate will be stable over the life of the project, and that cash inflows can be reinvested at the same discount rate. In the real world, those assumptions can break down, particularly in periods when interest rates are fluctuating. The appeal of the IRR rule is that a discount rate need not be assumed, as the worthiness of the investment is purely a function of the internal inflows and outflows of that particular investment. However, IRR does not assess the financial impact on a firm; it only requires meeting a minimum return rate. \n\nThe NPV and IRR methods can rank two projects differently, depending on thesize of the investment. Consider the case presented below, with an NPV of 6%:\n\n\n\n\n\nProject\n\n\nInitial outflow\n\n\nPayoff after one year\n\n\nIRR\n\n\nNPV\n\n\n\n\nA\n\n\n$250,000\n\n\n$280,000\n\n\n12%\n\n\n+$14,151\n\n\n\n\nB\n\n\n$50,000\n\n\n$60,000\n\n\n20%\n\n\n+6604\n\n\n\n\nBy the NPV rule we choose Project A, and by the IRR rule we prefer B. How do we resolve the conflict if we must choose one or the other? The convention is to use the NPV rule when the two methods are inconsistent, as it better reflects our primary goal: to grow the financial wealth of the company.\n\nConsequences of the IRR Method\nIn the previous section we demonstrated how smaller projects can have higher IRRs but will have less of a financial impact. Timing of cash flows also affects the IRR method. Consider the example below, on which initial investments are identical. Project A has a smaller payout and less of a financial impact (lower NPV), but since it is received sooner, it has a higher IRR. When inconsistencies arise, NPV is the preferred method. Assessing the financial impact is a more meaningful indicator for a capital-budgeting decision.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProject\n\n\nInvestment\n\n\nIncome in future periods\n\n\nIRR\n\n\nNPV\n\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\u00a0\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\u00a0\n\n\nt1\n\n\nt2\n\n\nt3\n\n\nt4\n\n\nt5\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\u00a0\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nA\n\n\n$100k\n\n\n$125k\n\n\n$0\n\n\n$0\n\n\n$0\n\n\n$0\n\n\n25.0%\n\n\n$17,925\n\n\n\n\nB\n\n\n$100k\n\n\n$0\n\n\n$0\n\n\n$0\n\n\n$0\n\n\n$200k\n\n\n14.9%\n\n\n$49,452\n\n\n\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_37", "text": "\nMoney-weighted and time-weighted rates of return are two methods of measuring performance, or the rate of return on an investment portfolio. Each of these two approaches has particular instances where it is the preferred method. Given the priority in today's environment on performance returns (particularly when comparing and evaluating money managers), the CFA exam will be certain to test whether a candidate understands each methodology.\nMoney-Weighted Rate of Return\nA money-weighted rate of return is identical in concept to an internal rate of return: it is the discount rate on which the NPV = 0 or the present value of inflows = present value of outflows. Recall that for the IRR method, we start by identifying all cash inflows and outflows. When applied to an investment portfolio:\nOutflows  \n1. The cost of any investment purchased \n2. Reinvested dividends or interest \n3. Withdrawals \nInflows\n1.The proceeds from any investment sold\n2.Dividends or interest received\n3.Contributions\nExample: \nEach inflow or outflow must be discounted back to the present using a rate (r) that will make PV (inflows) = PV (outflows). For example, take a case where we buy one share of a stock for $50 that pays an annual $2 dividend, and sell it after two years for $65. Our money-weighted rate of return will be a rate that satisfies the following equation:\nPV Outflows = PV Inflows = $2/(1 + r) + $2/(1 + r)2 + $65/(1 + r)2 = $50\nSolving for r using a spreadsheet or financial calculator, we have a money-weighted rate of return = 17.78%. \n\u00a0\nExam Tips and Tricks\n\t\t\tNote that the exam will test knowledge of the concept of money-weighted return, but any computations should not require use of a financial calculator\n\nIt's important to understand the main limitation of the money-weighted return as a tool for evaluating managers. As defined earlier, the money-weighted rate of return factors all cash flows, including contributions and withdrawals. Assuming a money-weighted return is calculated over many periods, the formula will tend to place a greater weight on the performance in periods when the account size is highest (hence the label money-weighted). \nIn practice, if a manager's best years occur when an account is small, and then (after the client deposits more funds) market conditions become more unfavorable, the money-weighted measure doesn't treat the manager fairly. Here it is put another way: say the account has annual withdrawals to provide a retiree with income, and the manager does relatively poorly in the early years (when the account is larger), but improves in later periods after distributions have reduced the account's size. Should the manager be penalized for something beyond his or her control? Deposits and withdrawals are usually outside of a manager's control; thus, a better performance measurement tool is needed to judge a manager more fairly and allow for comparisons with peers - a measurement tool that will isolate the investment actions, and not penalize for deposit/withdrawal activity.\nTime-Weighted Rate of Return\nThe time-weighted rate of return is the preferred industry standard as it is not sensitive to contributions or withdrawals. It is defined as the compounded growth rate of $1 over the period being measured. The time-weighted formula is essentially a geometric mean of a number of holding-period returns that are linked together or compounded over time (thus, time-weighted). The holding-period return, or HPR, (rate of return for one period) is computed using this formula:\n\u00a0\nFormula 2.8 \nHPR = ((MV1 - MV0 + D1 - CF1)/MV0)\n\n\t\t\tWhere: MV0 = beginning market value, MV1 = ending market value, \n\t\t\tD1 = dividend/interest inflows, CF1 = cash flow received at period end (deposits subtracted, withdrawals added back)\n\n\u00a0\nFor time-weighted performance measurement, the total period to be measured is broken into many sub-periods, with a sub-period ending (and portfolio priced) on any day with significant contribution or withdrawal activity, or at the end of the month or quarter. Sub-periods can cover any length of time chosen by the manager and need not be uniform. A holding-period return is computed using the above formula for all sub-periods. Linking (or compounding) HPRs is done by\n(a) adding 1 to each sub-period HPR, then\n(b) multiplying all 1 + HPR terms together, then\n(c) subtracting 1 from the product: \nCompounded time-weighted rate of return, for N holding periods\n= [(1 + HPR1)*(1 + HPR2)*(1 + HPR3) ... *(1 + HPRN)] - 1.\nThe annualized rate of return takes the compounded time-weighted rate and standardizes it by computing a geometric average of the linked holding-period returns.\n\u00a0\nFormula 2.9\n\t\t\tAnnualized rate of return = (1 + compounded rate)1/Y - 1\n\t\t\tWhere: Y = total time in years \n\nExample: Time-Weighted Portfolio Return\nConsider the following example: A portfolio was priced at the following values for the quarter-end dates indicated:\n\u00a0\n\nDate \nMarket Value\nDec. 31, 2003\n$200,000\nMarch 31, 2004\n$196,500\nJune 30, 2004\n$200,000\nSept. 30, 2004\n$243,000\nDec. 31, 2004\n$250,000\nOn Dec. 31, 2004, the annual fee of $2,000 was deducted from the account. On July 30, 2004, the annual contribution of $20,000 was received, which boosted the account value to $222,000 on July 30. How would we calculate a time-weighted rate of return for 2004?\nAnswer:\nFor this example, the year is broken into four holding-period returns to be calculated for each quarter. Also, since a significant contribution of $20,000 was received intra-period, we will need to calculate two holding-period returns for the third quarter, June 30, 2004, to July 30, 2004, and July 30, 2004, to Sept 30, 2004. In total, there are five HPRs that must be computed using the formula HPR = (MV1 - MV0 + D1 - CF1)/MV0. Note that since D1, or dividend payments, are already factored into the ending-period value, this term will not be needed for the computation. On a test problem, if dividends or interest is shown separately, simply add it to ending-period value. The calculations are done below (dollar amounts in thousands):\nPeriod 1 (Dec 31, 2003, to Mar 31, 2004): \nHPR = (($196.5 - $200)/$200) = (-3.5)/200 = -1.75%.\nPeriod 2 (Mar 31, 2004, to June 30, 2004): \nHPR = (($200 - $196.5)/$196.5) = 3.5/196.5 = +1.78%.\nPeriod 3 (June 30, 2004, to July 30, 2004): \nHPR = (($222 - $20) - $200)/$200) = 2/200 = +1.00%.\nPeriod 4 (July 30, 2004, to Sept 30, 2004): \nHPR = ($243 - $222)/$222 = 21/222 = +9.46%.\nPeriod 5 (Sept 30, 2004, to Dec 31, 2004): \nHPR = (($250 - $2) - $243)/$243 = 5/243 = +2.06%\nNow we link the five periods together, by adding 1 to each HPR, multiplying all terms, and subtracting 1 from the product, to find the compounded time- weighted rate of return: \n2004 return = ((1 + (-.0175))*(1 + 0.0178)*(1 + 0.01)*(1 + 0.0946)*(1 + 0.0206)) - 1 = ((0.9825)*(1.0178)*(1.01)*(1.0946)*(1.0206)) - 1 = (1.128288) - 1 = 0.128288, or 12.83% (rounding to the nearest 1/100 of a percent).\nAnnualizing: Because our compounded calculation was for one year, the annualized figure is the same +12.83%. If the same portfolio had a 2003 return of 20%, the two-year compounded number would be ((1 + 0.20)*(1 + 0.1283)) - 1, or 35.40%. Annualize by adding 1, and then taking to the 1/Y power, and then subtracting 1: (1 + 0.3540)1/2 - 1 = 16.36%.\nNote: The annualized number is the same as a geometric average, a concept covered in the statistics section. \nExample: Money Weighted Returns\nCalculating money-weighted returns will usually require use of a financial calculator if there are cash flows more than one period in the future. Earlier we presented a case where a money-weighted return for two periods was equal to the IRR, where NPV = 0. \nAnswer:\nFor money-weighted returns covering a single period, we know PV (inflows) - PV (outflows) = 0. If we pay $100 for a stock today, and sell it in one year later for $105, and collect a $2 dividend, we have a money-weighted return or IRR = ($105)/(1 + r) + ($2)/(1 + r) - $100 = $0. r = ($105 + $2)/$100 - 1, or 7%.\nMoney-weighted return = time-weighted return for a single period where the cash flow is received at the end. If the period is any time frame other than one year, take (1 + the result), raised to the power 1/Y and subtract 1 to find the annualized return.\n\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_38", "text": "\n\nCalculating Yield for a U.S. Treasury Bill\nA U.S. Treasury bill is the classic example of a pure discount instrument, where the interest the government pays is the difference between the amount it promises to pay back at maturity (the face value) and the amount it borrowed when issuing the T-bill (the discount). T-bills are short-term debt instruments (by definition, they have less than one year to maturity), and there is zero default risk with a U.S. government guarantee. After being issued, T-bills are widely traded in the secondary market, and are quoted based on the bank discount yield (i.e. the approximate annualized return the buyer should expect if holding until maturity). A bank discount yield (RBD) can be computed as follows:\n\n\n\n\nFormula 2.10\r\n\t\t\t\tRBD = D/F * 360/t\n\nWhere: D = dollar discount from face value, F = face value,\r\n\t\t\t\tT = days until maturity, 360 = days in a year \n\n\n\n\nBy bank convention, years are 360 days long, not 365. If you recall the joke about banker's hours being shorter than regular business hours, you should remember that banker's years are also shorter.\n\nFor example, if a T-bill has a face value of $50,000, a current market price of $49,700 and a maturity in 100 days, we have:\n\nRBD = D/F * 360/t = ($50,000-$49,700)/$50000 * 360/100 = 300/50000 * 3.6 = 2.16%\n\nOn the exam, you may be asked to compute the market price, given a quoted yield, which can be accomplish by using the same formula and solving for D:\n\n\n\n\n\nFormula 2.11\nD = RBD*F * t/360\n\n\n\n\nExample:\nUsing the previous example, if we have a bank discount yield of 2.16%, a face value of $50,000 and days to maturity of 100, then we calculate D as follows:\n\nD = (0.0216)*(50000)*(100/360) = 300 \n\nMarket price = F - D = 50,000 - 300 = $49,700\nHolding-Period Yield (HPY) \nHPY refers to the un-annualized rate of return one receives for holding a debt instrument until maturity. The formula is essentially the same as the concept of holding-period return needed to compute time-weighted performance. The HPY computation provides for one cash distribution or interest payment to be made at the time of maturity, a term that can be omitted for U.S. T-bills.\n\n\n\n\n\nFormula 2.12\nHPY = (P1 - P0 + D1)/P0\nWhere: P0 = purchase price, P1 = price at maturity, and D1= cash distribution at maturity\n\n\n\n\nExample:\nTaking the data from the previous example, we illustrate the calculation of HPY:\n\nHPY = (P1 - P0 + D1)/P0 = (50000 - 49700 + 0)/49700 = 300/49700 = 0.006036 or 0.6036%\nEffective annual yield (EAY) \nEAY takes the HPY and annualizes the number to facilitate comparability with other investments. It uses the same logic presented earlier when describing how to annualize a compounded return number: (1) add 1 to the HPY return, (2) compound forward to one year by carrying to the 365/t power, where t is days to maturity, and (3) subtract 1. \n\nHere it is expressed as a formula:\n\n\n\n\n\nFormula 2.13\nEAY = (1 + HPY)365/t - 1 \n\n\n\n\nExample:\nContinuing with our example T-bill, we have:\n\nEAY = (1 + HPY)365/t - 1 = (1 + 0.006036)365/100 - 1 = 2.22 percent.\n\nRemember that EAY > bank discount yield, for three reasons: (a) yield is based on purchase price, not face value, (b) it is annualized with compound interest (interest on interest), not simple interest, and (c) it is based on a 365-day year rather than 360 days. Be prepared to compare these two measures of yield and use these three reasons to explain why EAY is preferable.\n\nThe third measure of yield is the money market yield, also known as the CD equivalent yield, and is denoted by rMM. This yield measure can be calculated in two ways:\n\n1. When the HPY is given, rMM is the annualized yield based on a 360-day year: \n\n\n\n\n\nFormula 2.14\nrMM = (HPY)*(360/t)\nWhere: t = days to maturity \n\n\n\n\nFor our example, we computed HPY = 0.6036%, thus the money market yield is:\n\nrMM = (HPY)*(360/t) = (0.6036)*(360/100) = 2.173%.\n\n2. When bond price is unknown, bank discount yield can be used to compute the money market yield, using this expression:\n\n\n\n\n\nFormula 2.15\n\nrMM = (360* rBD)/(360 - (t* rBD) \n\n\n\n\nUsing our case:\n\nrMM = (360* rBD)/(360 - (t* rBD) = (360*0.0216)/(360 - (100*0.0216)) = 2.1735%, which is identical to the result at which we arrived using HPY.\n\nInterpreting Yield\nThis involves essentially nothing more than algebra: solve for the unknown and plug in the known quantities. You must be able to use these formulas to find yields expressed one way when the provided yield number is expressed another way. \n\nSince HPY is common to the two others (EAY and MM yield), know how to solve for HPY to answer a question.\n\n\n\n\n\nEffective Annual Yield\n\nEAY = (1 + HPY)365/t - 1 \n\nHPY = (1 + EAY)t/365 - 1\n\n\n\nMoney Market Yield\n\nrMM = (HPY)*(360/t)\n\nHPY = rMM * (t/360) \n\n\n\n\nBond Equivalent Yield\nThe bond equivalent yield is simply the yield stated on a semiannual basis multiplied by 2. Thus, if you are given a semiannual yield of 3% and asked for the bond equivalent yield, the answer is 6%.\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_39", "text": "\nThe term statistics is very broad. In some contexts it is used to refer to specific data. Statistics is also a branch of mathematics, a field of study - essentially the analysis tools and methods that are applied to data. Data, by itself, is nothing more than quantities and numbers. With statistics, data can be transformed into useful information and can be the basis for understanding and making intelligent comparisons and decisions. \n\nBasics\n\n\nDescriptive Statistics - Descriptive statistics are tools used to summarize and consolidate large masses of numbers and data so that analysts can get their hands around it, understand it and use it. The learning outcomes in this section of the guide (i.e. the statistics section) are focused on descriptive statistics. \n\n\nInferential Statistics - Inferential statistics are tools used to draw larger generalizations from observing a smaller portion of data. In basic terms, descriptive statistics intend to describe. Inferential statistics intend to draw inferences, the process of inferring. We will use inferential statistics in section D. Probability Concepts, later in this chapter.\n\nPopulation Vs. Sample\nA population refers to every member of a group, while a sample is a small subset of the population. Sampling is a method used when the task of observing the entire population is either impossible or impractical. Drawing a sample is intended to produce a smaller group with the same or similar characteristics as the population, which can then be used to learn more about the whole population.\n\nParameters and Sample Statistics\nA parameter is the set of tools and measures used in descriptive statistics. Mean, range and variance are all commonly used parameters that summarize and describe the population. A parameter describes the total population. Determining the precise value of any parameter requires observing every single member of the population. Since this exercise can be impossible or impractical, we use sampling techniques, which draw a sample that (the analyst hopes) represents the population. Quantities taken from a sample to describe its characteristics (e.g. mean, range and variance) are termed sample statistics. \n\nPopulation \u00ae Parameter Sample \u00ae Sample Statistic\n\nMeasurement Scales\nData is measured and assigned to specific points based on a chosen scale. A measurement scale can fall into one of four categories: \n\n\nNominal - This is the weakest level as the only purpose is to categorize data but not rank it in any way. For example, in a database of mutual funds, we can use a nominal scale for assigning a number to identify fund style (e.g. 1 for large-cap value, 2 for large-cap growth, 3 for foreign blend, etc.). Nominal scales don't lend themselves to descriptive tools - in the mutual fund example, we would not report the average fund style as 5.6 with a standard deviation of 3.2. Such descriptions are meaningless for nominal scales.\n\n\nOrdinal - This category is considered stronger than nominal as the data is categorized according to some rank that helps describe rankings or differences between the data. Examples of ordinal scales include the mutual fund star rankings (Morningstar 1 through 5 stars), or assigning a fund a rating between 1 and 10 based on its five-year performance and its place within its category (e.g. 1 for the top 10%, 2 for funds between 10% and 20% and so forth). An ordinal scale doesn't always fully describe relative differences - in the example of ranking 1 to 10 by performance, there may be a wide performance gap between 1 and 2, but virtually nothing between 6, 7, and 8. \n\n\nInterval - This is a step stronger than the ordinal scale, as the intervals between data points are equal, and data can be added and subtracted together. Temperature is measured on interval scales (Celsius and Fahrenheit), as the difference in temperature between 25 and 30 is the same as the difference between 85 and 90. However, interval scales have no zero point - zero degrees Celsius doesn't indicate no temperature; it's simply the point at which water freezes. Without a zero point, ratios are meaningless - for example, nine degrees is not three times as hot as three degrees.\n\n\nRatio - This category represents the strongest level of measurement, with all the features of interval scales plus the zero point, giving meaning to ratios on the scale. Most measurement scales used by financial analysts are ratios, including time (e.g. days-to-maturity for bonds), money (e.g. earnings per share for a set of companies) and rates of return expressed as a percentage. \n\nFrequency Distribution\nA frequency distribution seeks to describe large data sets by doing four things:\n\n(1) establishing a series of intervals as categories, \n(2) assigning every data point in the population to one of the categories, \n(3) counting the number of observations within each category and\n(4) presenting the data with each assigned category, and the frequency of observations in each category. \n\nFrequency distribution is one of the simplest methods employed to describe populations of data and can be used for all four measurement scales - indeed, it is often the best and only way to describe data measured on a nominal, ordinal or interval scale. Frequency distributions are sometimes used for equity index returns over a long history - e.g. the S&P 500 annual or quarterly returns grouped into a series of return intervals.\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_40", "text": "\nHolding Period Return\nThe holding return period formula was introduced previously when discussing time-weighted return measurement. The same formula applies when applied to frequency distributions (descriptions changed slightly):\n\n\n\n\n\nFormula 2.16\nRt = [(Pt - Pt - 1 + Dt)/ Pt - 1]\nWhere: Rt = holding period return for time period (t) and Pt = price of asset at end of time period t, Pt - 1 = price of asset at end of time period (t - 1),\r\n\t\t\t\tDt = cash distributions received during time t\n\n\n\n\nRelative and Cumulative Frequencies\r\nRelative frequency is calculated by dividing the absolute frequency of a particular interval by the total population. Cumulative relative frequency is a process where relative frequencies are added together to show the percentage of observations that fall at or below a certain point. For an illustration on calculating relative frequency and cumulative relative frequency, refer to the following frequency distribution for quarterly returns over the last 10 years for a mutual fund:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuarterly return interval\n\n\nNumber of observations (absolute frequency)\n\n\nRelative frequency\n\n\nCumulative absolute frequency\n\n\nCumulative relative frequency\n\n\n\n\n-15% to -10%\n\n\n2\n\n\n5.0%\n\n\n2\n\n\n5.0%\n\n\n\n\n-10% to -5%\n\n\n1\n\n\n2.5%\n\n\n3\n\n\n7.5%\n\n\n\n\n-5% to 0%\n\n\n5\n\n\n12.5%\n\n\n8\n\n\n20.0%\n\n\n\n\n0% to +5%\n\n\n17\n\n\n42.5%\n\n\n25\n\n\n62.5%\n\n\n\n\n+5% to +10%\n\n\n10\n\n\n25.0%\n\n\n35\n\n\n87.5%\n\n\n\n\n+10% to +15%\n\n\n2\n\n\n5.0%\n\n\n37\n\n\n92.5%\n\n\n\n\n+15% to +20%\n\n\n3\n\n\n7.5%\n\n\n40\n\n\n100.0%\n\n\n\n\nThere are 40 observations in this distribution (last 10 years, four quarters per year), and the relative frequency is found by dividing the number in the second column by 40. The cumulative absolute frequency (fourth column) is constructed by adding the frequency of all observations at or below that point. So for the fifth interval, +5% to +10%, we find the cumulative absolute frequency by adding the absolute frequency in the fifth interval and all previous intervals: 2+1+5+17+10=35. The last column, cumulative relative frequency, takes the number in the fourth column and divides by 40, the total number of observations.\n\nHistograms and Frequency Polygons\nA histogram is a frequency distribution presented as a bar chart, with number of observations on the Y axis and intervals on the X. \n\nThe frequency distribution above is presented as a histogram in figure 2.2 below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.2: Histogram\n\n\n\n\nA return polygon presents a line chart rather than a bar chart. Here is the data from the frequency distribution presented with a return polygon: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.3: Return Polygon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLook Out!\r\n\t\t\t\tYou may be asked to describe the data presented for a histogram or frequency polygon. Most likely this would involve evaluating risk by indicating that there are two examples of the most negative outcomes (i.e. quarters below -10%, category 1). Also you may be asked how normally distributed the graph appears. Normal distributions are detailed later in this study guide.\n\n\n\n\nCentral Tendency\nThe term \"measures of central tendency\" refers to the various methods used to describe where large groups of data are centered in a population or a sample. Here it is stated another way: if we were to pull one value or observation from a population or sample, what would we typically expect the value to be? Various methods are used to calculate central tendency. The most frequently used is the arithmetic mean, or the sum of observations divided by the number of observations.\n\nExample: Arithmetic Mean\nFor example, if we have 20 quarters of return data:\n\n-1.5%-2.5%+5.6%+10.7%\n\n+0.8%-7.7%-10.1% +2.2%\n\n+12.0%+10.9% -2.6% +0.2%\n\n-1.9%-6.2%+17.1% +4.8%\n\n+9.1% +3.0% -0.2% +1.8%\n\nWe find the arithmetic mean by adding the 20 observations together, then dividing by 20.\n\n((-1.5%) + (-2.5%) + 5.6% + 10.7% + 0.8% + (7.7%) + (-10.1%) + 2.2% + 12.0% + 10.9% + (-2.6%) + 0.2% + (-1.9%) + (-6.2%) + 17.1% + 4.8% + 9.1% + 3.0% + (-0.2%) + 1.8%) = 45.5%  \n\nArithmetic mean = 45.5%/20 = 2.275%\nThe mean is usually interpreted as answering the question of what will be the most likely outcome, or what represents the data most fairly. \n\nThe arithmetic mean formula is used to compute population mean (often denoted by the Greek symbol \u03bc), which is the arithmetic mean of the entire population. The population mean is an example of a parameter, and by definition it must be unique. That is, a given population can have only one mean. The sample mean (denoted by X or X-bar) is the arithmetic mean value of a sample. It is an example of a sample statistic, and will be unique to a particular sample. In other words, five samples drawn from the same population may produce five different sample means.\n\nWhile the arithmetic mean is the most frequently used measure of central tendency, it does have shortcomings that in some cases tend to make it misleading when describing a population or sample. In particular, the arithmetic mean is sensitive to extreme values. \n\nExample: \nFor example, let's say we have the following five observations: -9000, 1.4, 1.6, 2.4 and 3.7. The arithmetic mean is -1798.2 [(-9000 + 1.4 + 1.6 + 2.4 + 3.7)/5], yet -1798.2 has little meaning in describing our data set. \n\nThe outlier (-9000) draws down the overall mean. Statisticians use a variety of methods to compensate for outliers, such as, for example, eliminating the highest and lowest value before calculating the mean. \n\nFor example, by dropping -9000 and 3.7, the three remaining observations have a mean of 1.8, a more meaningful description of the data. Another approach is to use either the median or mode, or both.\nWeighted Average or Mean\nThe weighted average or weighted mean, when applied to a portfolio, takes the mean return of each asset class and weights it by the allocation of each class. \nSay a portfolio manager has the following allocation and mean annual performance returns achieved for each class:\n\n\n\n\n\nAsset Class\n\nPortfolio weight\n\nMean annual return\n\n\n\nU.S. Large Cap\n\n30%\n\n9.6%\n\n\n\nU.S. Mid Cap\n\n15%\n\n11.2%\n\n\n\nU.S. Small Cap\n\n10%\n\n7.4%\n\n\n\nForeign (Developed Mkts.)\n\n15%\n\n8.8%\n\n\n\nEmerging Markets\n\n8%\n\n14.1%\n\n\n\nFixed Income (short/intermediate)\n\n12%\n\n4.1%\n\n\n\nFixed Income (long maturities)\n\n7%\n\n6.6%\n\n\n\nCash/Money Market\n\n3%\n\n2.1%\n\n\n\n\nThe weighted mean is calculated by weighting the return on each class and summing:\n\nPortfolio return = (0.30)*(0.096) + (0.15)*(0.112) + (0.10)*(0.074) + (0.15)*(0.088) + (0.08)*(0.141) + (0.12)*(0.041) + (0.07)*(0.066) + (0.03)*(0.021) = 8.765%\n\nMedian\nMedian is defined as the middle value in a series that is sorted in either ascending or descending order. In the example above with five observations, the median, or middle value, is 1.6 (i.e. two values below 1.6, and two values above 1.6). In this case, the median is a much fairer indication of the data compared to the mean of -1798.2. \n\nMode\nMode is defined as the particular value that is most frequently observed. In some applications, the mode is the most meaningful description. Take a case with a portfolio of ten mutual funds and their respective ratings: 5, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 2 and 1. The arithmetic mean rating is 3.5 stars. However in this example, the modal rating of four describes the majority of observations and might be seen as a fairer description.\n\nWeighted Mean\nWeighted mean is frequently seen in portfolio problems in which various assets classes are weighted within the portfolio - for example, if stocks comprise 60% of a portfolio, then 0.6 is the weight. A weighted mean is computed by multiplying the mean of each weight by the weight, and then summing the products. \n\nTake an example where stocks are weighted 60%, bonds 30% and cash 10%. Assume that the stock portion returned 10%, bonds returned 6% and cash returned 2%. The portfolio's weighted mean return is:\n\nStocks (wtd) + Bonds (wtd) + Cash (wtd) = (0.6)*(0.1) + (0.3)*(0.06) + (0.1)*(0.02) = (0.06) + (0.018) + (0.002) = 8%\n\nGeometric Mean\nWe initially introduced the geometric mean earlier in the computations for time-weighted performance. It is usually applied to data in percentages: rates of return over time, or growth rates. With a series of n observations of statistic X, the geometric mean (G) is:\n\n\n\n\n\nFormula 2.1 7\nG = (X1*X2*X3*X4 ... *Xn)1/n\n\n\n\n\nSo if we have a four-year period in which a company's sales grew 4%, 5%, \n-3% and 10%, here is the calculation of the geometric mean:\n\nG = ((1.04)*(1.05)*(0.97)*(1.1))1/4 - 1 = 3.9%. \n\nIt's important to gain experience with using geometric mean on percentages, which involves linking the data together: (1) add 1 to each percentage, (2) multiply all terms together, (3) carry the product to the 1/n power and (4) subtract 1 from the result.\n\nHarmonic mean is computed by the following steps:\n\n1. Taking the reciprocal of each observation, or 1/X, \n\n2. Adding these terms together, \n\n3. Averaging the sum by dividing by n, or the total number of observations, \n\n4. Taking the reciprocal of this result. \n\nThe harmonic mean is most associated with questions about dollar cost averaging, but its use is limited. Arithmetic mean, weighted mean and geometric mean are the most frequently used measures and should be the main emphasis of study.\n\nQuartiles, Quintiles, Deciles, and Percentiles.\nThese terms are most associated with cases where the point of central tendency is not the main goal of the research study. For example, in a distribution of five-year performance returns for money managers, we may not be interested in the mean performer (i.e. the manager at the 50% level), but rather in those in the top 10% or top 20% of the distribution. Recall that the median essentially divides a distribution in half. \n\nBy the same process, quartiles are the result of a distribution being divided into four parts; quintiles refer to five parts; deciles, 10 parts; and percentiles, 100 parts. A manager in the second quintile would be better than 60% (bottom three quintiles) and below 20% (the top quintile) (i.e. somewhere between 20% and 40% in percentile terms). A manager at the 21st percentile has 20 percentiles above, 79 percentiles below. \n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_41", "text": "\n\nRange and Mean Absolute Deviation \nThe range is the simplest measure of dispersion, the extent to which the data varies from its measure of central tendency. Dispersion or variability is a concept covered extensively in the CFA curriculum, as it emphasizes risk, or the chances that an investment will not achieve its expected outcome. If any investment has two dimensions - one describing risk, one describing reward - then we must measure and present both dimensions to gain an idea of the true nature of the investment. Mean return describes the expected reward, while the measures of dispersion describe the risk.\n\nRange \nRange is simply the highest observation minus the lowest observation. For data that is sorted, it should be easy to locate maximum/minimum values and compute the range. The appeal of range is that it is simple to interpret and easy to calculate; the drawback is that by using just two values, it can be misleading if there are extreme values that turn out to be very rare, and it may not fairly represent the entire distribution (all of the outcomes).\n\nMean Absolute Deviation (MAD) \nMAD improves upon range as an indicator of dispersion by using all of the data. It is calculated by: \n\n1. Taking the difference between each observed value and the mean, which is the deviation \n\n2. Using the absolute value of each deviation, adding all deviations together \n\n3. Dividing by n, the number of observations.\n\nExample: \nTo illustrate, we take an example of six mid-cap mutual funds, on which the five-year annual returns are +10.1, +7.7%, +5.0, +12.3%, +12.2% and +10.9%.\n\nAnswer:\nRange = Maximum - Minimum = (+12.3%) - (+5.0%) = 7.3%\n\nMean absolute deviation starts by finding the mean: (10.1% + 7.7% + 5.0% + 12.3% + 12.2% + 10.9%)/6 = 9.7%.\n\nEach of the six observations deviate from the 9.7%; the absolute deviation ignores +/-.\n\n1st: 10.1 - 9.7 = 0.4 3rd: 5.0 - 9.7 = 4.7 5th: 12.2 - 9.7 = 2.5\n\n2nd: 7.7 - 9.7 = 2.0 4th: 12.3 - 9.7 = 2.6 6th: 10.9 - 9.7 = 1.2\n\nNext, the absolute deviations are summed and divided by 6:(0.4 + 2.0 + 4.7 + 2.6 + 2.5 + 1.2)/6 = 13.4/6 = 2.233333, or rounded, 2.2%.\nVariance\nVariance (\u03c32) is a measure of dispersion that in practice can be easier to apply than mean absolute deviation because it removes +/- signs by squaring the deviations.\n\nReturning to the example of mid-cap mutual funds, we had six deviations. To compute variance, we take the square of each deviation, add the terms together and divide by the number of observations.\n\n\n\n\n\nObservation\n\nValue\n\nDeviation from +9.7%\n\nSquare of Deviation\n\n\n\n1\n\n+10.1%\n\n0.4 \n\n0.16\n\n\n\n2\n\n+7.7%\n\n2.0\n\n4.0\n\n\n\n3\n\n+5.0%\n\n4.7\n\n22.09\n\n\n\n4\n\n+12.3%\n\n2.6\n\n6.76\n\n\n\n5\n\n+12.2%\n\n2.5\n\n6.25\n\n\n\n6\n\n+10.9%\n\n1.2\n\n1.44\n\n\n\n\nVariance = (0.16 + 4.0 + 22.09 + 6.76 + 6.25 + 1.44)/6 = 6.7833. Variance is not in the same units as the underlying data. In this case, it's expressed as 6.7833% squared - difficult to interpret unless you are a mathematical expert (percent squared?).\n\nStandard Deviation\nStandard deviation (\u03c3) is the square root of the variance, or (6.7833)1/2 = 2.60%. Standard deviation is expressed in the same units as the data, which makes it easier to interpret. It is the most frequently used measure of dispersion.\n\nOur calculations above were done for a population of six mutual funds. In practice, an entire population is either impossible or impractical to observe, and by using sampling techniques, we estimate the population variance and standard deviation. The sample variance formula is very similar to the population variance, with one exception: instead of dividing by n observations (where n = population size), we divide by (n - 1) degrees of freedom, where n = sample size. So in our mutual fund example, if the problem was described as a sample of a larger database of mid-cap funds, we would compute variance using n - 1, degrees of freedom.\n\nSample variance (s2) = (0.16 + 4.0 + 22.09 + 6.76 + 6.25 + 1.44)/(6 - 1) = 8.14\n\nSample Standard Deviation (s)\nSample standard deviation is the square root of sample variance: \n\n(8.14)1/2 = 2.85%.\n\nIn fact, standard deviation is so widely used because, unlike variance, it is expressed in the same units as the original data, so it is easy to interpret, and can be used on distribution graphs (e.g. the normal distribution).\n\nSemivariance and Target Semivariance\r\nSemivariance is a risk measure that focuses on downside risk, and is defined as the average squared deviation below the mean. Computing a semivariance starts by using only those observations below the mean, that is, any observations at or above the mean are ignored. From there, the process is similar to computing variance. If a return distribution is symmetric, semivariance is exactly half of the variance. If the distribution is negatively skewed, semivariance can be higher. The idea behind semivariance is to focus on negative outcomes. \n\nTarget semivariance is a variation of this concept, considering only those squared deviations below a certain target. For example, if a mutual fund has a mean quarterly return of +3.6%, we may wish to focus only on quarters where the outcome is -5% or lower. Target semivariance eliminates all quarters above -5%. From there, the process of computing target semivariance follows the same procedure as other variance measures.\n\nChebyshev's Inequality\nChebyshev's inequality states that the proportion of observations within k standard deviations of an arithmetic mean is at least 1 - 1/k2, for all k > 1.\n\n\n\n\n\n# of Standard Deviations from Mean (k)\n\nChebyshev\\'s Inequality\n\n% of Observations\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t2\n\r\n\t\t\t\t1 - 1/(2)2, or 1 - 1/4, or 3/4\n\r\n\t\t\t\t75 (.75)\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t3\n\r\n\t\t\t\t1 - 1/(3)2, or 1 - 1/9, or\n\r\n\t\t\t\t89 (.8889)\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t4\n\r\n\t\t\t\t1 - 1/(4)2, or 1 - 1/16, or 15/16\n\r\n\t\t\t\t94 (.9375)\n\n\n\n\nGiven that 75% of observations fall within two standard deviations, if a distribution has an annual mean return of 10% and a standard deviation of 5%, we can state that in 75% of the years, the return will be anywhere from 0% to 20%. In 25% of the years, it will be either below 0% or above 20%. Given that there are 89% falling within three standard deviations means that in 89% of the years, the return will be within a range of -5% to +25%. Eleven percent of the time it won't.\n\nLater we will learn that for so-called normal distributions, we expect about 95% of the observations to fall within two standard deviations. Chebyshev's inequality is more general and doesn't assume a normal distribution, that is, it applies to any shaped distribution.\n\nCoefficient of Variation\nThe coefficient of variation (CV) helps the analyst interpret relative dispersion. In other words, a calculated standard deviation value is just a number. Does this number indicate high or low dispersion? The coefficient of variation helps describe standard deviation in terms of its proportion to its mean by this formula:\n\n\n\n\n\nFormula 2.18\nCV = s/X\n\nWhere: s = sample standard deviation, X = sample mean\n\n\n\n\nSharpe Ratio\nThe Sharpe ratio is a measure of the risk-reward tradeoff of an investment security or portfolio. It starts by defining excess return, or the percentage rate of return of a security above the risk-free rate. In this view, the risk-free rate is a minimum rate that any security should earn. Higher rates are available provided one assumes higher risk. \n\nThe Sharpe ratio is calculated by dividing the ratio of excess return, to the standard deviation of return.\n\n\n\n\n\nFormula 2.19\nSharpe ratio = [(mean return) - (risk-free return)] / standard deviation of return\n\n\n\n\nExample: Sharpe Ratio\nIf an emerging-markets fund has a historic mean return of 18.2% and a standard deviation of 12.1%, and the return on three-month T-bills (our proxy for a risk-free rate) was 2.3%, the Sharpe ratio = (18.2)-(2.3)/12.1 = 1.31. In other words, for every 1% of additional risk we accept by investing in this emerging markets fund, we are rewarded with an excess 1.31%. Part of the reason that the Sharpe ratio has become popular is that it's an easy to understand and appealing concept, for practitioners and investors.\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_42", "text": "\n\nSkew\nSkew, or skewness, can be mathematically defined as the averaged cubed deviation from the mean divided by the standard deviation cubed. If the result of the computation is greater than zero, the distribution is positively skewed. If it's less than zero, it's negatively skewed and equal to zero means it's symmetric. For interpretation and analysis, focus on downside risk. Negatively skewed distributions have what statisticians call a long left tail (refer to graphs on previous page), which for investors can mean a greater chance of extremely negative outcomes. Positive skew would mean frequent small negative outcomes, and extremely bad scenarios are not as likely.\nA nonsymmetrical or skewed distribution occurs when one side of the distribution does not mirror the other. Applied to investment returns, nonsymmetrical distributions are generally described as being either positively skewed (meaning frequent small losses and a few extreme gains) or negatively skewed (meaning frequent small gains and a few extreme losses). \n\u00a0\n\n\nPositive Skew\nNegative Skew\n\u00a0\nFigure 2.4\n\nFor positively skewed distributions, the mode (point at the top of the curve) is less than the median (the point where 50% are above/50% below), which is less than the arithmetic mean (sum of observations/number of observations). The opposite rules apply to negatively skewed distribution: mode is greater than median, which is greater than arithmetic mean.\nPositive: Mean > Median > Mode Negative: Mean < Median < Mode\nNotice that by alphabetical listing, it's mean \u00e0 median \u00e0 mode. For positive skew, they are separated with a greater than sign, for negative, less than.\nKurtosisKurtosis refers to the degree of peak in a distribution. More peak than normal (leptokurtic) means that a distribution also has fatter tails and that there are more chances of extreme outcomes compared to a normal distribution. \nThe kurtosis formula measures the degree of peak. Kurtosis equals three for a normal distribution; excess kurtosis calculates and expresses kurtosis above or below 3. \nIn figure 2.5 below, the solid line is the normal distribution; the dashed line is leptokurtic distribution.\n\u00a0\n\nFigure 2.5: Kurtosis\n\nSample Skew and Kurtosis\nFor a calculated skew number (average cubed deviations divided by the cubed standard deviation), look at the sign to evaluate whether a return is positively skewed (skew > 0), negatively skewed (skew < 0) or symmetric (skew = 0). A kurtosis number (average deviations to the fourth power divided by the standard deviation to the fourth power) is evaluated in relation to the normal distribution, on which kurtosis = 3. Since excess kurtosis = kurtosis - 3, any positive number for excess kurtosis would mean the distribution is leptokurtic (meaning fatter tails and lesser risk of extreme outcomes).\n\u00a0\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_43", "text": "\nTo help make logical and consistent investment decisions, and help manage expectations in an environment of risk, an analyst uses the concepts and tools found in probability theory. A probability refers to the percentage chance that something will happen, from 0 (it is impossible) to 1 (it is certain to occur), and the scale going from less likely to more likely. Probability concepts help define risk by quantifying the prospects for unintended and negative outcomes; thus probability concepts are a major focus of the CFA curriculum.\n\nI. Basics\n\nRandom Variable\nA random variable refers to any quantity with uncertain expected future values. For example, time is not a random variable since we know that tomorrow will have 24 hours, the month of January will have 31 days and so on. However, the expected rate of return on a mutual fund and the expected standard deviation of those returns are random variables. We attempt to forecast these random variables based on past history and on our forecast for the economy and interest rates, but we cannot say for certain what the variables will be in the future - all we have are forecasts or expectations.\n\nOutcome \nOutcome refers to any possible value that a random variable can take. For expected rate of return, the range of outcomes naturally depends on the particular investment or proposition. Lottery players have a near-certain probability of losing all of their investment (-100% return), with a very small chance of becoming a multimillionaire (+1,000,000% return - or higher!). Thus for a lottery ticket, there are usually just two extreme outcomes. Mutual funds that invest primarily in blue chip stocks will involve a much narrower series of outcomes and a distribution of possibilities around a specific mean expectation. When a particular outcome or a series of outcomes are defined, it is referred to as an event. If our goal for the blue chip mutual fund is to produce a minimum 8% return every year on average, and we want to assess the chances that our goal will not be met, our event is defined as average annual returns below 8%. We use probability concepts to ask what the chances are that our event will take place.\n\nEvent\nIf a list of events ismutually exclusive, it means that only one of them can possibly take place. Exhaustive events refer to the need to incorporate all potential outcomes in the defined events. For return expectations, if we define our two events as annual returns equal to or greater than 8% and annual returns equal to or less than 8%, these two events would not meet the definition of mutually exclusive since a return of exactly 8% falls into both categories. If our defined two events were annual returns less than 8% and annual returns greater than 8%, we've covered all outcomes except for the possibility of an 8% return; thus our events are not exhaustive.\n\nThe Defining Properties of Probability\nProbability has two defining properties:\n\n\nThe probability of any event is a number between 0 and 1, or 0 < P(E) < 1. A P followed by parentheses is the probability of (event E) occurring. Probabilities fall on a scale between 0, or 0%, (impossible) and 1, or 100%, (certain). There is no such thing as a negative probability (less than impossible?) or a probability greater than 1 (more certain than certain?). \n\n\nThe sum of all probabilities of all events equals 1, provided the events are both mutually exclusive and exhaustive. If events are not mutually exclusive, the probabilities would add up to a number greater than 1, and if they were not exhaustive, the sum of probabilities would be less than 1. Thus, there is a need to qualify this second property to ensure the events are properly defined (mutually exclusive, exhaustive). On an exam question, if the probabilities in a research study are added to a number besides 1, you might question whether this principle has been met.\n\nThese terms refer to the particular approach an analyst has used to define the events and make predictions on probabilities (i.e. the likelihood of each event occurring). How exactly does the analyst arrive at these probabilities? What exactly are the numbers based upon? The approach is empirical, subjective or a priori.\n\nEmpirical Probabilities\nEmpirical probabilities are objectively drawn from historical data. If we assembled a return distribution based on the past 20 years of data, and then used that same distribution to make forecasts, we have used an empirical approach. Of course, we know that past performance does not guarantee future results, so a purely empirical approach has its drawbacks. \n\nSubjective Probabilities\nRelationships must be stable for empirical probabilities to be accurate and for investments and the economy, relationships change. Thus, subjective probabilities are calculated; these draw upon experience and judgment to make forecasts or modify the probabilities indicated from a purely empirical approach. Of course, subjective probabilities are unique to the person making them and depend on his or her talents - the investment world is filled with people making incorrect subjective judgments. \n\nA Priori Probabilities\nA priori probabilities represent probabilities that are objective and based on deduction and reasoning about a particular case. For example, if we forecast that a company is 70% likely to win a bid on a contract (based on an either empirical or subjective approach), and we know this firm has just one business competitor, then we can also make an a priori forecast that there is a 30% probability that the bid will go to the competitor. \n\n\n\n\nExam Tips and Tricks\r\n\t\t\t\tKnow how to distinguish between the empirical, subjective and a priori probabilities listed above.\n\n\n\n\nStating the Probability of an Event as Odds \"For\" or \"Against\"\n\nGiven a probability P(E),\n\nOdds \"FOR\" E = P(E)/[1 - P(E)] A probability of 20% would be \"1 to 4\".\n\nOdds \"AGAINST\" E = [1 - P(E)]/P(E) A probability of 20% would be \"4 to 1\".\n\nExample:\r\n\tTake an example of two financial-services companies, whose publicly traded share prices reflect a certain probability that interest rates will fall. Both firms will receive an equal benefit from lower interest rates. However, an analyst's research reveals that Firm A's shares, at current prices, reflect a 75% likelihood that rates will fall, and Firm B's shares only suggest a 40% chance of lower rates. The analyst has discovered (in probability terms) mutually inconsistent probabilities. In other words, rates can't be (simultaneously) both 75% and 40% likely to fall. If the true probability of lower rates is 75% (i.e. the market has fairly priced this probability into Firm A's shares), then as investors we could profit by buying Firm B's undervalued shares. If the true probability is 40%, we could profit by short selling Firm A's overpriced shares. By taking both actions (in a classic pairs arbitrage trade), we would theoretically profit no matter the actual probability since one stock or the other eventually has to move. Many investment decisions are made based on an analyst's perception of mutually inconsistent probabilities. \nUnconditional Probability \nUnconditional probability is the straightforward answer to this question: what is the probability of this one event occurring? In probability notation, the unconditional probability of event A is P(A), which asks, what is the probability of event A? If we believe that a stock is 70% likely to return 15% in the next year, then P(A) = 0.7, which is that event's unconditional probability.\n\nConditional Probability\nConditional probability answers this question: what is the probability of this one event occurring, given that another event has already taken place? A conditional probability has the notation P(A | B), which represents the probability of event A, given B. If we believe that a stock is 70% likely to return 15% in the next year, as long as GDP growth is at least 3%, then we have made our prediction conditional on a second event (GDP growth). In other words, event A is the stock will rise 15% in the next year; event B is GDP growth is at least 3%; and our conditional probability is P(A | B) = 0.9.\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_44", "text": "\nJoint probability is defined as the probability of both A and B taking place, and is denoted by P(AB). \n\nJoint probability is not the same as conditional probability, though the two concepts are often confused. Conditional probability assumes that one event has taken place or will take place, and then asks for the probability of the other (A, given B). Joint probability does not have such conditions; it simply asks for the chances of both happening (A and B). In a problem, to help distinguish between the two, look for qualifiers that one event is conditional on the other (conditional) or whether they will happen concurrently (joint).\n\nProbability definitions can find their way into CFA exam questions. Naturally, there may also be questions that test the ability to calculate joint probabilities. Such computations require use of the multiplication rule, which states that the joint probability of A and B is the product of the conditional probability of A given B, times the probability of B. In probability notation:\n\n\n\n\n\nFormula 2.20\nMultiplication rule: P(AB) = P(A | B) * P(B)\n\n\n\n\nGiven a conditional probability P(A | B) = 40%, and a probability of B = 60%, the joint probability P(AB) = 0.6*0.4 or 24%, found by applying the multiplication rule.\n\nThe Addition Rule\nThe addition rule is used in situations where the probability of at least one of two given events - A and B - must be found. This probability is equal to the probability of A, plus the probability of B, minus the joint probability of A and B.\n\n\n\n\n\nFormula 2.21\nAddition Rule: P(A or B) = P(A) + P (B) - P(AB)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example, if the probability of A = 0.4, and the probability of B = 0.45, and the joint probability of both is 0.2, then the probability of either A or B = 0.4 + 0.45 - 0.2 = 0.65. \n\nRemembering to subtract the joint probability P(AB) is often the difficult part of applying this rule. Indeed, if the addition rule is required to solve a probability problem on the exam, you can be sure that the wrong answers will include P(A) + P(B), and P(A)*P(B). Just remember that the addition rule is asking for either A or B, so you don't want to double count. Thus, the probability of both A and B, P(AB), is an intersection and needs to be subtracted to arrive at the correct probability.\n\nDependent and Independent Events\nTwo events are independent when the occurrence of one has no effect on the probability that the other will occur. Earlier we established the definition of a conditional probability, or the probability of A given B, P(A | B). If A is completely independent of B, then this conditional probability is the same as the unconditional probability of A. Thus the definition of independent events states that two events - A and B - are independent of each other, if, and only if, P(A | B) = P(A). By the same logic, B would be independent of A if, and only if, P(B | A), which is the probability of B given that A has occurred, is equal to P(B). \n\nTwo events are not independent when the conditional probability of A given B is higher or lower than the unconditional probability of A. In this case, A is dependent on B. Likewise, if P(B | A) is greater or less than P(B), we know that B depends on A. \n\nCalculating the Joint Probability of Two or More Independent Events\nRecall that for calculating joint probabilities, we use the multiplication rule, stated in probability notation as P(AB) = P(A | B) * P(B). For independent events, we've now established that P(A | B) = P(A), so by substituting P(A) into the equation for P(A | B), we see that for independent events, the multiplication rule is simply the product of the individual probabilities.\n\n\n\n\nFormula 2.22\nMultiplication rule, independent events: P(AB) = P(A) * P(B)AB)\n\n\n\n\nMoreover, the rule generalizes for more than two events provided they are all independent of one another, so the joint probability of three events P(ABC) = P(A) * (P(B) * P(C), again assuming independence.\n\nThe Total Probability Rule\r\nThe total probability rule explains an unconditional probability of an event, in terms of that event's conditional probabilities in a series of mutually exclusive, exhaustive scenarios. For the simplest example, there are two scenarios, S and the complement of S, or SC, and P(S) + P(SC) = 1, given the properties of being mutually exclusive and exhaustive. How do these two scenarios affect event A? P(A | S) and P(A | SC) are the conditional probabilities that event A will occur in scenario S and in scenario SC, respectively. If we know the conditional probabilities, and we know the probability of the two scenarios, we can use the total probability rule formula to find the probability of event A.\n\n\n\n\n\nFormula 2.23\nTotal probability rule (two scenarios): P(A) = P(A | S)*P(S) + P(A | SC)*P(SC)\n\n\n\n\nThis rule is easiest to remember if you compare the formula to the weighted-mean calculation used to compute rate of return on a portfolio. In that exercise, each asset class had an individual rate of return, weighted by its allocation to compute the overall return. With the total probability rule, each scenario has a conditional probability (i.e. the likelihood of event A, given that scenario), with each conditional probability weighted by the probability of that scenario occurring.\n\nExample: Total Probability\nSo if we define conditional probabilities of P(A | S) = 0.4, and P(A | SC) = 0.25, and the scenarios P(S) and P(SC) are 0.8 and 0.2 respectively, the probability of event A is:\n\nP(A) = P(A | S)*P(S) + P(A | SC)*P(SC) = (0.4)*(0.8) + (0.25)*(0.2) = 0.37.\n\nThe total probability rule applies to three or more scenarios provided they are mutually exclusive and exhaustive. The formula is the sum of all weighted conditional probabilities (weighted by the probability of each scenario occurring). \n\nUsing Probability and Conditional Expectations in Making Investment Decisions\nInvestment decisions involve making future predictions based upon all information that we believe is relevant to our forecast. However, these forecasts are dynamic; they are always subject to change based on new information being made public. In many cases this new information causes us to modify our forecasts and either raise or lower our opinion on an investment. In other words, our expected values are conditional on changing real-world events, and thus can never be perceived as unconditional probabilities. In fact, a random variable's expected value is the weighted average of conditional probabilities, weighted by the probability of each scenario (where scenarios are mutually exclusive and exhaustive). The total probability rule applies to determining expected values. \n\nExpected Value Methodology\nAn expected value of a random variable is calculated by assigning a probability to each possible outcome and then taking a probability-weighted average of the outcomes.\n\nExample: Expected Value\nAssume that an analyst writes a report on a company and, based on the research, assigns the following probabilities to next year's sales:\n\n\n\n\n\nScenario\n\nProbability\n\nSales ($ Millions)\n\n\n\n1\n\n0.10\n\n$16\n\n\n\n2\n\n0.30\n\n$15\n\n\n\n3\n\n0.30\n\n$14\n\n\n\n3\n\n0.30\n\n$13\n\n\n\n\nAnswer:\nThe analyst's expected value for next year's sales is (0.1)*(16.0) + (0.3)*(15.0) + (0.3)*(14.0) + (0.3)*(13.0) = $14.2 million.\n\nThe total probability rule for finding the expected value of variable X is given by E(X) = E(X | S)*P(S) + E(X | SC)*P(SC) for the simplest case: two scenarios, S and SC, that are mutually exclusive and exhaustive. If we refer to them as Scenario 1 and Scenario 2, then E(X | S) is the expected value of X in Scenario 1, and E(X | SC) is the expected value of X in Scenario 2.\n\nTree Diagram\nThe total probability rule can be easier to visualize if the information is presented in a tree diagram. Take a case where we have forecasted company sales to be anywhere in a range from $13 to $16 million, based on conditional probabilities. \n\nThis company is dependent on the overall economy and on Wal-Mart's same-store sales growth, leading to the conditional probability scenarios demonstrated in figure 2.7 below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a good economy, our expected sales would be 25% likely to be $16 million, and 75% likely to be $15 million, depending on Wal-Mart's growth number. In a bad economy, we would be equally likely to generate $13 million if Wal-Mart sales drop more than 2% or $14 million (if the growth number falls between -2% and +1.9%).\n\nExpected sales (good economy) = (0.25)*(16) + (0.75)*(15) = 15.25 million.\n\nExpected sales (bad economy) = (0.5)*(13) + (0.5)*(14) = 13.5 million.\n\nWe predict that a good economy is 40% likely, and a bad economy 60% likely, leading to our expected value for sales: (0.4)*(15.25) + (0.6)*(13.5) = 14.2 million.\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_45", "text": "\nCovariance\r\nCovariance is a measure of the relationship between two random variables, designed to show the degree of co-movement between them. Covariance is calculated based on the probability-weighted average of the cross-products of each random variable's deviation from its own expected value. A positive number indicates co-movement (i.e. the variables tend to move in the same direction); a value of 0 indicates no relationship, and a negative covariance shows that the variables move in the opposite direction.\n\r\nThe process for actually computing covariance values is complicated and time-consuming, and it is not likely to be covered on a CFA exam question. Although the detailed formulas and examples of computations are presented in the reference text, for most people, spending too much valuable study time absorbing such detail will have you bogged down with details that are unlikely to be tested.\n\nCorrelation\r\nCorrelation is a concept related to covariance, as it also gives an indication of the degree to which two random variables are related, and (like covariance) the sign shows the direction of this relationship (positive (+) means that the variables move together; negative (-) means they are inversely related). Correlation of 0 means that there is no linear relationship one way or the other, and the two variables are said to be unrelated.\n\r\nA correlation number is much easier to interpret than covariance because a correlation value will always be between -1 and +1.\n\n\r\n\t\t-1 indicates a perfectly inverse relationship (a unit change in one means that the other will have a unit change in the opposite direction)\n\r\n\t\t+1 means a perfectly positive linear relationship (unit changes in one always bring the same unit changes in the other).\n\r\nMoreover, there is a uniform scale from -1 to +1 so that as correlation values move closer to 1, the two variables are more closely related. By contrast, a covariance value between two variables could be very large and indicate little actual relationship, or look very small when there is actually a strong linear correlation.\n\nCorrelation is defined as the ratio of the covariance between two random variables and the product of their two standard deviations, as presented in the following formula:\n\n\n\n\n\nFormula 2.24\r\n\t\t\t\tCorrelation (A, B) =  _____Covariance (A, B) \r\n\t\t\t\tStandard Deviation (A)* Standard Deviation (B)\n\n\n\n\r\nAs a result: Covariance (A, B) = Correlation (A, B)*Standard Deviation (A)*Standard Deviation (B)\n\r\nBoth correlation and covariance with these formulas are likely to be required in a calculation in which the other terms are provided. Such an exercise simply requires remembering the relationship, and substituting the terms provided. For example, if a covariance between two numbers of 30 is given, and standard deviations are 5 and 15, the correlation would be 30/(5)*(15) = 0.40. If you are given a correlation of 0.40 and standard deviations of 5 and 15, the covariance would be (0.4)*(5)*(15), or 30.\n\nExpected Return, Variance and Standard Deviation of a Portfolio\r\nExpected return is calculated as the weighted average of the expected returns of the assets in the portfolio, weighted by the expected return of each asset class. For a simple portfolio of two mutual funds, one investing in stocks and the other in bonds, if we expect the stock fund to return 10% and the bond fund to return 6%, and our allocation is 50% to each asset class, we have:\n\r\nExpected return (portfolio) = (0.1)*(0.5) + (0.06)*(0.5) = 0.08, or 8%\n\nVariance (\u03c32) is computed by finding the probability-weighted average of squared deviations from the expected value.\n\nExample: Variance\r\nIn our previous example on making a sales forecast, we found that the expected value was $14.2 million. Calculating variance starts by computing the deviations from $14.2 million, then squaring:\n\n\n\n\nScenario\n\nProbability\n\nDeviation from Expected Value\n\nSquared\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t1\n\r\n\t\t\t\t0.1\n\r\n\t\t\t\t(16.0 - 14.2) = 1.8\n\r\n\t\t\t\t3.24\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t2\n\r\n\t\t\t\t0.30\n\r\n\t\t\t\t(15.0 - 14.2) = 0.8\n\r\n\t\t\t\t0.64\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t3\n\r\n\t\t\t\t0.30\n\r\n\t\t\t\t(14.0 - 14.2) = - 0.2\n\r\n\t\t\t\t0.04\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t4\n\r\n\t\t\t\t0.30\n\r\n\t\t\t\t(13.0 - 14.2) = - 1.2\n\r\n\t\t\t\t1.44\n\n\n\n\nAnswer:\r\nVariance weights each squared deviation by its probability: (0.1)*(3.24) + (0.3)*(0.64) + (0.3)*(0.04) + (0.3)*(1.44) = 0.96\n\r\nThe variance of return is a function of the variance of the component assets as well as the covariance between each of them. In modern portfolio theory, a low or negative correlation between asset classes will reduce overall portfolio variance. The formula for portfolio variance in the simple case of a two-asset portfolio is given by:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormula 2.25\r\n\t\t\t\tPortfolio Variance = w2A*\u03c32(RA) + w2B*\u03c32(RB) + 2*(wA)*(wB)*Cov(RA, RB)\nWhere: wA and wB are portfolio weights, \u03c32(RA) and \u03c32(RB) are variances and\r\n\t\t\t\tCov(RA, RB) is the covariance \n\n\n\n\nExample: Portfolio Variance\r\nData on both variance and covariance may be displayed in a covariance matrix. Assume the following covariance matrix for our two-asset case:\n\n\n\n\nStock\n\nBond\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\tStock\n\r\n\t\t\t\t350\n\r\n\t\t\t\t80\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\tBond\n\r\n\t\t\t\t80\n\n\n\n\r\nFrom this matrix, we know that the variance on stocks is 350 (the covariance of any asset to itself equals its variance), the variance on bonds is 150 and the covariance between stocks and bonds is 80. Given our portfolio weights of 0.5 for both stocks and bonds, we have all the terms needed to solve for portfolio variance.\n\nAnswer:\r\nPortfolio variance = w2A*\u03c32(RA) + w2B*\u03c32(RB) + 2*(wA)*(wB)*Cov(RA, RB) =(0.5)2*(350) + (0.5)2*(150) + 2*(0.5)*(0.5)*(80) = 87.5 + 37.5 + 40 = 165.\n\nStandard Deviation (\u03c3), as was defined earlier when we discuss statistics, is the positive square root of the variance. In our example, \u03c3 = (0.96)1/2, or $0.978 million.\n\r\nStandard deviation is found by taking the square root of variance:\n\r\n(165)1/2 = 12.85%.\n\r\nA two-asset portfolio was used to illustrate this principle; most portfolios contain far more than two assets, and the formula for variance becomes more complicated for multi-asset portfolios (all terms in a covariance matrix need to be added to the calculation).\n\nJoint Probability Functions and Covariance\r\nLet's now apply the joint probability function to calculating covariance:\n\nExample: Covariance from a Joint Probability Function\r\nTo illustrate this calculation, let's take an example where we have estimated the year-over-year sales growth for GM and Ford in three industry environments: strong (30% probability), average (40%) and weak (30%).

For an analyst, learning from experience takes the form of adjusting expectations (and probability estimates) based on new information. Bayes' formula essentially takes this principle and applies it to the probability concepts we have already learned, by showing how to calculate an updated probability, the new probability given this new information. Bayes' formula is the updated probability, given new information:\n\r\nBayes' Formula:\n\nConditional probability of new info. given the event * (Prior probability of the event)\r\nUnconditional Probability of New Info\n\n\n\n\n\nFormula 2.26\r\n\t\t\t\tP(E | I) = P(I | E) / P(I) * P(E)\nWhere: E = event, I = new info\n\n\n\n\nThe Multiplication Rule of Counting\r\nThe multiplication rule of counting states that if the specified number of tasks is given by k and n1, n2, n3, ... nk are variables used for the number of ways each of these tasks can be done, then the total number of ways to perform k tasks is found by multiplying all of the n1, n2, n3, ... nk variables together.\n\r\nTake a process with four steps:\n\n\n\n\n\nStep\n\nNumber of ways\r\n\t\t\t\tthis step can be done\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t1\n\r\n\t\t\t\t6\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t2\n\r\n\t\t\t\t3\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t3\n\r\n\t\t\t\t1\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t4\n\r\n\t\t\t\t5\n\n\n\n\r\nThis process can be done a total of 90 ways.

In counting problems, it is used when there is a given group of size n, and the exercise is to assign the group to n slots; then the number of ways these assignments could be made is given by n!. If we were managing five employees and had five job functions, the number of possible combinations is 5! = 120.\n\nCombination Notation\r\nCombination notation refers to the number of ways that we can choose r objects from a total of n objects, when the order in which the r objects is listed does not matter.\n\r\nIn shorthand notation:\n\n\n\n\nFormula 2.27 \n\nnCr = n =  n! \r\n\t\t\t\tr (n - r)!*r!\n\n\n\n\r\nThus if we had our five employees and we needed to choose three of them to team up on a new project, where they will be equal members (i.e. the order in which we choose them isn't important), formula tells us that there are 5!/(5 - 3)!3! = 120/(2)*(6) = 120/12, or 10 possible combinations.\n\nPermutation notation\r\nPermutation notation takes the same case (choosing r objects from a group of n) but assumes that the order that \"r\" is listed matters.

All of these variables have uncertain outcomes; thus there is risk that any downside uncertainty can result in a surprising and material impact. By understanding the mechanics of probability distributions, such risks can be understood and analyzed, and measures taken to hedge or reduce their impact.\n\nProbability Distribution\nA probability distribution gathers together all possible outcomes of a random variable (i.e. any quantity for which more than one value is possible), and summarizes these outcomes by indicating the probability of each of them. While a probability distribution is often associated with the bell-shaped curve, recognize that such a curve is only indicative of one specific type of probability, the so-called normal probability distribution. The CFA curriculum does focus on normal distributions since they frequently apply to financial and investment variables, and are used in hypothesis testing. However, in real life, a probability distribution can take any shape, size and form.\n\nExample: Probability Distribution\nFor example, say if we wanted to choose a day at random in the future to schedule an event, and we wanted to know the probability that this day would fall on a Sunday, as we will need to avoid scheduling it on a Sunday. With seven days in a week, the probability that a random day would happen to be a Sunday would be given by one-seventh or about 14.29%. Of course, the same 14.29% probability would be true for any of the other six days. \n\nIn this case, we would have a uniform probability distribution: the chances that our random day would fall on any particular day are the same, and the graph of our probability distribution would be a straight line.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.8: Probability Distribution\n\n\n\n\nProbability distributions can be simple to understand as in this example, or they can be very complex and require sophisticated techniques (e.g., option pricing models, Monte Carlo simulations) to help describe all possible outcomes.\n\nDiscrete Random Variables\nDiscrete random variables can take on a finite or countable number of possible outcomes. The previous example asking for a day of the week is an example of a discrete variable, since it can only take seven possible values. Monetary variables expressed in dollars and cents are always discrete, since money is rounded to the nearest $0.01. In other words, we may have a formula that suggests a stock worth $15.75 today will be $17.1675 after it grows 9%, but you can't give or receive three-quarters of a penny, so our formula would round the outcome of 9% growth to an amount of $17.17. \n\nContinuous Random Variables\nA continuous random variable has infinite possible outcomes. A rate of return (e.g. growth rate) is continuous: \n\n\na stock can grow by 9% next year or by 10%, and in between this range it could grow by 9.3%, 9.4%, 9.5%\n\nin between 9.3% and 9.4% the rate could be 9.31%, 9.32%, 9.33%, and in between 9.32% and 9.33% it could grow 9.32478941%\n\nclearly there is no end to how precise the outcomes could be broken down; thus it's described as a continuous variable. \n\nOutcomes in Discrete vs. Continuous Variables\nThe rule of thumb is that a discrete variable can have all possibilities listed out, while a continuous variable must be expressed in terms of its upper and lower limits, and greater-than or less-than indicators. Of course, listing out a large set of possible outcomes (which is usually the case for money variables) is usually impractical - thus money variables will usually have outcomes expressed as if they were continuous. \n\nRates of return can theoretically range from -100% to positive infinity. Time is bound on the lower side by 0. Market price of a security will also have a lower limit of $0, while its upper limit will depend on the security - stocks have no upper limit (thus a stock price's outcome > $0), but bond prices are more complicated, bound by factors such as time-to-maturity and embedded call options. If a face value of a bond is $1,000, there's an upper limit (somewhere above $1,000) above which the price of the bond will not go, but pinpointing the upper value of that set is imprecise.\n\nProbability Function\nA probability function gives the probabilities that a random variable will take on a given list of specific values. For a discrete variable, if (x1, x2, x3, x4 ...) are the complete set of possible outcomes, p(x) indicates the chances that X will be equal to x. Each x in the list for a discrete variable will have a p(x). For a continuous variable, a probability function is expressed as f(x).\n\nThe two key properties of a probability function, p(x) (or f(x) for continuous), are the following:\n\n\n0 < p(x) < 1, since probability must always be between 0 and 1.\n\nAdd up all probabilities of all distinct possible outcomes of a random variable, and the sum must equal 1.\n\nDetermining whether a function satisfies the first property should be easy to spot since we know that probabilities always lie between 0 and 1. In other words, p(x) could never be 1.4 or -0.2. To illustrate the second property, say we are given a set of three possibilities for X: (1, 2, 3) and a set of three for Y: (6, 7, 8), and given the probability functions f(x) and g(y).\n\n\n\n\n\nx\n\nf(x)\n\ny\n\ng(y)\n\n\n\n1\n\n0.31\n\n6\n\n0.32\n\n\n\n2\n\n0.43\n\n7\n\n0.40\n\n\n\n3\n\n0.26\n\n8\n\n0.23\n\n\n\n\nFor all possibilities of f(x), the sum is 0.31+0.43+0.26=1, so we know it is a valid probability function. For all possibilities of g(y), the sum is 0.32+0.40+0.23 = 0.95, which violates our second principle. Either the given probabilities for g(y) are wrong, or there is a fourth possibility for y where g(y) = 0.05. Either way it needs to sum to 1.\n\nProbability Density Function\nA probability density function (or pdf) describes a probability function in the case of a continuous random variable. Also known as simply the \"density\", a probability density function is denoted by \"f(x)\". Since a pdf refers to a continuous random variable, its probabilities would be expressed as ranges of variables rather than probabilities assigned to individual values as is done for a discrete variable. For example, if a stock has a 20% chance of a negative return, the pdf in its simplest terms could be expressed as: \n\n\n\n\nx\n\nf(x)\n\n\n\n< 0\n\r\n\t\t\t\t0.2\n\n\n\n> 0\n\r\n\t\t\t\t0.8\n\n\n\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_47", "text": "\n\nCumulative Distribution Functions \r\nA cumulative distribution function or CDF, expresses a probability's function in terms of lowest to highest value, by giving the probability that a random variable X is less than or equal to a particular value x. Expressed in shorthand, the cumulative distribution function is P(X < x). A cumulative distribution function is constructed by summing up, or cumulating all values in the probability function that are less than or equal to x. The concept is similar to the cumulative relative frequency covered earlier in this study guide, which computed values below a certain point in a frequency distribution.\n\nExample: Cumulative Distribution Function\r\nFor example, the following probability distribution includes the cumulative function.\n\n\n\n\nX = x \n\nP(X = x)\n\nP(X < x) or cdf\n\n\n\n< -12\n\r\n\t\t\t\t0.15\n\r\n\t\t\t\t0.15\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t-12 to -3\n\r\n\t\t\t\t0.15\n\r\n\t\t\t\t0.30\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t-3 to 4\n\r\n\t\t\t\t0.25\n\r\n\t\t\t\t0.55\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t4 to 10\n\r\n\t\t\t\t0.25\n\r\n\t\t\t\t0.80\n\n\n\n> 10\n\r\n\t\t\t\t0.2\n\r\n\t\t\t\t1.0\n\n\n\n\n\r\nFrom the table, we find that the probability that x is less than or equal to 4 is 0.55, the summed probabilities of the first three P(X) terms, or the number found in the cdf column for the third row, where x < 4. Sometimes a question might ask for the probability of x being greater than 4, for which this problem is 1 - P(x < 4) = 1 - 0.55 = 0.45. This is a question most people should get - but one that will still have too many people answering 0.55 because they weren't paying attention to the \"greater than\".\n\nDiscrete Uniform Random Variable\r\nA discrete uniform random variable is one that fulfills the definition of \"discrete\", where there are a finite and countable number of terms, along with the definition of \"uniform\", where there is an equally likely probability that the random variable X will take any of its possible values x. If there are n possible values for a discrete uniform random variable, the probability of a specific outcome is 1/n.\n\nExample: Discrete Uniform Random Variable\r\nEarlier we provided an example of a discrete uniform random variable: a random day is one-seventh likely to fall on a Sunday. To illustrate some examples on how probabilities are calculated, take the following discrete uniform distribution with n = 5.\n\n\n\n\n\nX = x\n\nP(X = x) \n\nP(X < x)\n\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t2\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t0.2\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t0.2\n\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t4\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t0.2\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t0.4\n\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t6\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t0.2\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t0.6\n\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t8\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t0.2\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t0.8\n\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t10\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t0.2\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t1.0\n\n\n\n\r\nAccording to the distribution above, we have the probability of x = 8 as 0.2. The probability of x = 2 is the same, 0.2.\n\r\nSuppose that the question called for P(4 < X < 8). The answer would be the sum of P(4) + P(6) + P(8) = 0.2 + 0.2 + 0.2 = 0.6.\n\r\nSuppose the question called for P(4 < X < 8). In this case, the answer would omit P(4) and P(8) since it's less than, NOT less than or equal to, and the correct answer would be P(6) = 0.2. The CFA exam writers love to test whether you are paying attention to details and will try to trick you - the probability of such tactics is pretty much a 1.0!\n\nBinomial Random Variable\r\nBinomial probability distributions are used when the context calls for assessing two outcomes, such as \"success/failure\", or \"price moved up/price moved down\". In such situations where the possible outcomes are binary, we can develop an estimate of a binomial random variable by holding a number of repeating trials (also known as \"Bernoulli trials\"). In a Bernoulli trial, p is the probability of success, (1 - p) is the probability of failure. Suppose that a number of Bernoulli trails are held, with the number denoted by n. A binomial random variable X is defined as the numberof successes in n Bernoulli trials, given two simplifying assumptions: (1) the probabilityp of success is the same for all trials and (2) the trials are independent of each other.\n\r\nThus, a binomial random variable is described by two parameters: p (the probability of success of one trial) and n (the number of trials). A binomial probability distribution with p = 0.50 (equal chance of success or failure) and n = 4 would appear as:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nx (# of successes)\n\n\np(x)\n\n\ncdf, P(X < x)\n\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t0\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t0.0625\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t0.0625\n\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t1\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t0.25\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t0.3125\n\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t2\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t0.375\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t0.6875\n\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t3\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t0.25\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t0.9325\n\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t4\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t0.0625\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t1.0000\n\n\n\n\r\nThe reference text demonstrates how to construct a binomial probability distribution by using the formula p(x) = (n!/(n - x)!x!)*(px)*(1 - p)n-x. We used this formula to assemble the above data, though the exam would probably not expect you to create each p(x); it would probably provide you with the table, and ask for an interpretation. For this table, the probability of exactly one success is 0.25; the probability of three or fewer successes is 0.9325 (the cdf value in the row where x = 3); the probability of at least one is 0.9325 (1 - P(0)) = (1 - 0.0625) = 0.9325.\n\nCalculations\r\nThe expected value of a binomial random variable is given by the formula n*p. In the example above, with n = 4 and p = 0.5, the expected value would be 4*0.5, or 2.\n\r\nThe variance of a binomial random variable is calculated by the formula n*p*(1 - p). Using the same example, we have variance of 4*0.5*0.5 = 1.\n\r\nIf our binomial random variable still had n = 4 but with a greater predictability in the trial, say p = 9, our variance would reduce to 4*0.9*0.1 = 0.36. For successive trials (i.e. for higher n), both mean and variance increase but variance increases at a lower rate - thus the higher the n, the better the model works at predicting probability.\n\nCreating a Binomial Tree\r\nThe binomial tree is essentially a diagram showing that the future value of a stock is the product of a series of up or down movements leading to a growing number of possible outcomes. Each possible value is called a node.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\tFigure 2.9: Binomial Tree\n\n\n\n\nContinuous Uniform Distribution\r\nA continuous uniform distribution describes a range of outcomes, usually bound with an upper and lower limit, where any point in the range is a possibility. Since it is a range, there are infinite possibilities within the range. In addition, all outcomes are all equally likely (i.e. they are spread uniformly throughout the range).\n\r\nTo calculate probabilities, find the area under a pdf curve such as the one graphed here. In this example, what is the probability that the random variable will be between 1 and 3? The area would be a rectangle with a width of 2 (the distance between 1 and 3), and height of 0.2, 2*0.2 = 0.4.\n\r\nWhat is the probability that x is less than 3? The rectangle would have a width of 3 and the same height: 0.2. 3*0.2 = 0.6\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_48", "text": "\n\nNormal Distribution\nThe normal distribution is a continuous probability distribution that, when graphed as a probability density, takes the form of the so-called bell-shaped curve. The bell shape results from the fact that, while the range of possible outcomes is infinite (negative infinity to positive infinity), most of the potential outcomes tend to be clustered relatively close to the distribution's mean value. Just how close they are clustered is given by the standard deviation. In other words, a normal distribution is described completely by two parameters: its mean (\u03bc) and its standard deviation (\u03c3). \n\nHere are other defining characteristics of the normal distribution: it is symmetric, meaning the mean value divides the distribution in half and one side is the exact mirror image of the other -that is, skewness = 0. Symmetry also requires that mean = median = mode. Its kurtosis (measure of peakedness) is 3 and its excess kurtosis (kurtosis - 3) equals 0. Also, if given 2 or more normally distributed random variables, the linear combination must also be normally distributed. \n\nWhile any normal distribution will share these defining characteristics, the mean and standard deviation will be unique to the random variable, and these differences will affect the shape of the distribution. On the following page are two normal distributions, each with the same mean, but the distribution with the dotted line has a higher standard deviation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnivariate vs. Multivariate Distributions\r\nA univariate distribution specifies probabilities for a single random variable, while a multivariate distribution combines the outcomes of a group of random variables and summarizes probabilities for the group. For example, a stock will have a distribution of possible return outcomes; those outcomes when summarized would be in a univariable distribution. A portfolio of 20 stocks could have return outcomes described in terms of 20 separate univariate distributions, or as one multivariate distribution.\n\nEarlier we indicated that a normal distribution is completely described by two parameters: its mean and standard deviation. This statement is true of a univariate distribution. For models of multivariate returns, the mean and standard deviation of each variable do not completely describe the multivariate set. A third parameter is required, the correlation, or co-movement, between each pair of variables in the set. For example, if a multivariate return distribution was being assembled for a portfolio of stocks, and a number of pairs were found to be inversely related (i.e. one increases at the same time the other decreases), then we must consider the overall effect on portfolio variance. For a group of assets that are not completely positively related, there is the opportunity to reduce overall risk (variance) as a result of the interrelationships.\n\nFor a portfolio distribution with n stocks, the multivariate distribution is completely described by the n mean returns, the n standard deviations and the n*(n - 1)/2 correlations. For a 20-stock portfolio, that's 20 lists of returns, 20 lists of variances of return and 20*19/2, or 190 correlations.\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_49", "text": "\nWhile a normally-distributed random variable can have many potential outcomes, the shape of its distribution gives us confidence that the vast majority of these outcomes will fall relatively close to its mean. In fact, we can quantify just how confident we are. By using confidence intervals - ranges that are a function of the properties of a normal bell-shaped curve - we can define ranges of probabilities. \n\nThe diagram below has a number of percentages - these numbers (which are approximations and rounded off) indicate the probability that a random outcome will fall into that particular section below the curve.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn other words, by assuming normal distribution, we are 68% confident that a variable will fall within one standard deviation. Within two standard deviation intervals, our confidence grows to 95%. Within three standard deviations, 99%. Take an example of a distribution of returns of a security with a mean of 10% and a standard deviation of 5%:\n\n\n68% of the returns will be between 5% and 15% (within 1 standard deviation, 10 + 5). \n\n95% of the returns will be between 0% and 20% (within 2 std. devs., 10 + 2*5).\n\n99% of the returns will be between -5% and 25% (within 3 std. devs., 10 + 3*5)\n\nStandard Normal Distribution \nStandard normal distribution is defined as a normal distribution where mean = 0 and standard deviation = 1. Probability numbers derived from the standard normal distribution are used to help standardize a random variable - i.e. express that number in terms of how many standard deviations it is away from its mean.\n\nStandardizing a random variable X is done by subtracting X from the mean value (\u03bc), and then dividing the result by the standard deviation (\u03c3). The result is a standard normal random variable which is denoted by the letter Z. \n\n\n\n\n\nFormula 2.31\nZ = (X - \u03bc)/\u03c3\n\n\n\n\nExample 1:\nIf a distribution has a mean of 10 and standard deviation of 5, and a random observation X is -2, we would standardize our random variable with the equation for Z.\n\nZ = (X - \u03bc)/ \u03c3 = (-2 - 10)/5 = -12/5 = -2.4 \n\nThe standard normal random variable Z tells us how many standard deviations the observation is from the mean. In this case, -2 translates to 2.4 standard deviations away from 10.\n\nExample 2:\r\nYou are considering an investment portfolio with an expected return of 10% and a standard deviation of 8%. The portfolio's returns are normally distributed. What is the probability of earning a return less than 2%?\n\r\nAgain, we'd start with standardizing random variable X, which in this case is 10%:\n\r\nZ = (X - \u03bc)/ \u03c3 = (2 - 10)/8 = -8/8 = -1.0\n\nNext, one would often consult a Z-table for cumulative probabilities for a standard normal distribution in order to determine the probability. In this case, for Z = -1, P(Z \u2264 x) - 0.158655, or 16%. \n\nTherefore, there is a 16% probability of earning a return of less than 2%. \n\nKeep in mind that your upcoming exam will not provide Z-tables, so, how would you solve this problem on test day?\n\nThe answer is that you need to remember that 68% of observations fall + 1 standard deviation on a normal curve, which means that 32% are not within one standard deviation. This question essentially asked for probability of more than one standard deviation below, or 32%/2 = 16%. Study the earlier diagram that shows specific percentages for certain standard deviation intervals on a normal curve - in particular, remember 68% for + one away, and remember 95% for + two away.\n\nShortfall Risk \nShortfall risk is essentially a refinement of the modern-day development of mean-variance analysis, that is, the idea that one must focus on both risk and return as opposed to simply the return. Risk is typically measured by standard deviation, which measures all deviations - i.e. both positive and negative. In other words, positive deviations are treated as if they were equal to negative deviations. In the real world, of course, negative surprises are far more important to quantify and predict with clarity if one is to accurately define risk. Two mutual funds could have the same risk if measured by standard deviation, but if one of those funds tends to have more extreme negative outcomes, while the other had a high standard deviation due to a preponderance of extreme positive surprises, then the actual risk profiles of those funds would be quite different. Shortfall risk defines a minimum acceptable level, and then focuses on whether a portfolio will fall below that level over a given time period.\n\nRoy's Safety-First Ratio\nAn optimal portfolio is one that minimizes the probability that the portfolio's return will fall below a threshold level. In probability notation, if RP is the return on the portfolio, and RL is the threshold (the minimum acceptable return), then the portfolio for which P(RP < RL) is minimized will be the optimal portfolio according to Roy's safety-first criterion. The safety-first ratio helps compute this level by giving the number of standard deviations between the expected level and the minimum acceptable level, with the higher number considered safer.\n\n\n\n\n\nFormula 2.32\nSFRatio = (E(RP) - RL)/ \u03c3P\n\n\n\n\nExample: Roy's Safety First Ratio\nLet's say our minimum threshold is -2%, and we have the following expectations for portfolios A and B:\n\n\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\u00a0\n\r\n\t\t\t\tPortfolio A\n\r\n\t\t\t\tPortfolio B\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\tExpected Annual Return\n\r\n\t\t\t\t8%\n\r\n\t\t\t\t12%\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\tStandard Deviation\n\r\n\t\t\t\t10%\n\r\n\t\t\t\t16%\n\n\n\n\nAnswer:\nThe SFRatio for portfolio A is (8 - (-2))/10 = 1.0\nThe SFRatio for portfolio B is (12 - (-2))/16 = 0.875\n\nIn other words, the minimum threshold is one standard deviation away in Portfolio A, and just 0.875 away in Portfolio B, so by safety-first rules we opt for Portfolio A.\n\nLognormal Distributions\nA lognormal distribution has two distinct properties: it is always positive (bounded on the left by zero), and it is skewed to the right. Prices for stocks and many other financial assets (anything which by definition can never be negative) are often found to be lognormally distributed. Also, the lognormal and normal distributions are related: if a random variable X is lognormally distributed, then its natural log, ln(X) is normally distributed. (Thus the term \"lognormal\" - the log is normal.) Figure 2.11 below demonstrates a typical lognormal distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_50", "text": "\nIn discrete compounded rates of return, time moves forward in increments, with each increment having a rate of return (ending price / beginning price) equal to 1. Of course, the more frequent the compounding, the higher the rate of return. Take a security that is expected to return 12% annually:\n\n\nWith annual holding periods, 12% compounded once = (1.12)1 - 1 = 12%.\n\nWith quarterly holding periods, 3% compounded 4 times = (1.03)4 - 1 = 12.55%\n\nWith monthly holding periods, 1% compounded 12 times = (1.01)12 - 1 = 12.68%\n\nWith daily holding periods, (12/365) compounded 365 times = 12.7475%\n\nWith hourly holding periods, (12/(365*24) compounded (365*24) times = 12.7496%\n\nWith greater frequency of compounding (i.e. as holding periods become smaller and smaller) the effective rate gradually increases but in smaller and smaller amounts. Extending this further, we can reduce holding periods so that they are sliced smaller and smaller so they approach zero, at which point we have the continuously compounded rate of return. Discrete compounding relates to measurable holding periods and a finite number of holding periods. Continuous compounding relates to holding periods so small they cannot be measured, with frequency of compounding so large it goes to infinity.\n\nThe continuous rate associated with a holding period is found by taking the natural log of 1 + holding-period return) Say the holding period is one year and holding-period return is 12%:\n\nln (1.12) = 11.33% (approx.) \n\nIn other words, if 11.33% were continuously compounded, its effective rate of return would be about 12%. \n\nEarlier we found that 12% compounded hourly comes to about 12.7496%. In fact, e (the transcendental number) raised to the 0.12 power yields 12.7497% (approximately).\n\nAs we've stated previously, actual calculations of natural logs are not likely for answering a question as they give an unfair advantage to those with higher function calculators. At the same time, an exam problem can test knowledge of a relationship without requiring the calculation. For example, a question could ask:\n\r\nQ. A portfolio returned 5% over one year, if continuously compounded, this is equivalent to ____? \n\nA. ln 5 \nB. ln 1.05 \nC. e5 \nD. e1.05\n\nThe answer would be B based on the definition of continuous compounding. A financial function calculator or spreadsheet could yield the actual percentage of 4.879%, but wouldn't be necessary to answer the question correctly on the exam.\n\n\nMonte Carlo Simulation\nA Monte Carlo Simulation refers to a computer-generated series of trials where the probabilities for both risk and reward are tested repeatedly in an effort to help define these parameters. These simulations are characterized by large numbers of trials - typically hundreds or even thousands of iterations, which is why it's typically described as \"computer generated\". Also know that Monte Carlo simulations rely on random numbers to generate a series of samples. \n\nMonte Carlo simulations are used in a number of applications, often as a complement to other risk-assessment techniques in an effort to further define potential risk. For example, a pension-benefit administrator in charge of managing assets and liabilities for a large plan may use computer software with Monte Carlo simulation to help understand any potential downside risk over time, and how changes in investment policy (e.g. higher or lower allocations to certain asset classes, or the introduction of a new manager) may affect the plan. While traditional analysis focuses on returns, variances and correlations between assets, a Monte Carlo simulation can help introduce other pertinent economic variables (e.g. interest rates, GDP growth and foreign exchange rates) into the simulation.\n\nMonte Carlo simulations are also important in pricing derivative securities for which there are no existing analytical methods. European- and Asian-style options are priced with Monte Carlo methods, as are certain mortgage-backed securities for which the embedded options (e.g. prepayment assumptions) are very complex. \n\nA general outline for developing a Monte Carlo simulation involves the following steps (please note that we are oversimplifying a process that is often highly technical):\n\n\nIdentify all variables about which we are interested, the time horizon of the analysis and the distribution of all risk factors associated with each variable.\n\nDraw K random numbers using a spreadsheet generator. Each random variable would then be standardized so we have Z1, Z2, Z3... ZK. \n\nSimulate the possible values of the random variable by calculating its observed value with Z1, Z2, Z3... ZK. \n\nFollowing a large number of iterations, estimate each variable and quantity of interest to complete one trial. Go back and complete additional trials to develop more accurate estimates.\n\nHistorical Simulation\r\nHistorical simulation, or back simulation, follows a similar process for large numbers of iterations, with historical simulation drawing from the previous record of that variable (e.g. past returns for a mutual fund). While both of these methods are very useful in developing a more meaningful and in-depth analysis of a complex system, it's important to recognize that they are basically statistical estimates; that is, they are not as analytical as (for example) the use of a correlation matrix to understand portfolio returns. Such simulations tend to work best when the input risk parameters are well defined.\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_51", "text": "\nA data sample, or subset of a larger population, is used to help understand the behavior and characteristics of the entire population. In the investing world, for example, all of the familiar stock market averages are samples designed to represent the broader stock market and indicate its performance return. For the domestic publicly-traded stock market, populated with at least 10,000 or more companies, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) has just 30 representatives; the S&P 500 has 500. Yet these samples are taken as valid indicators of the broader population. It's important to understand the mechanics of sampling and estimating, particularly as they apply to financial variables, and have the insight to critique the quality of research derived from sampling efforts.\n\nBASICS\n\r\nSimple Random Sampling\nTo begin the process of drawing samples from a larger population, an analyst must craft a sampling plan, which indicates exactly how the sample was selected. With a large population, different samples will yield different results, and the idea is to create a consistent and unbiased approach. Simple random sampling is the most basic approach to the problem. It draws a representative sample with the principle that every member of the population must have an equal chance of being selected. The key to simple random sampling is assuring randomness when drawing the sample. This requirement is achieved a number of ways, most rigorously by first coding every member of the population with a number, and then using a random number generator to choose a subset. \n\nSometimes it is impractical or impossible to label every single member of an entire population, in which case systematic sampling methods are used. For example, take a case where we wanted to research whether the S&P 500 companies were adding or laying off employees, but we didn't have the time or resources to contact all 500 human resources departments. We do have the time and resources for an in-depth study of a 25-company sample. A systematic sampling approach would be to take an alphabetical list of the S&P 500 and contact every 25th company on the list, i.e. companies #25, #50, #75, etc., up until #500. This way we end up with 25 companies and it was done under a system that's approximately random and didn't favor a particular company or industry.\n\nSampling Error\nSuppose we polled our 25 companies and came away with a conclusion that the typical S&P 500 firm will be adding approximately 5% to their work force this fiscal year, and, as a result, we are optimistic about the health of the economy. However, the daily news continues to indicate a fair number of layoffs at some companies and hiring freezes at other firms, and we wonder whether this research has actually done its job. In other words, we suspect sampling error: the difference between the statistic from our sample (5% job growth) and the population parameter we were estimating (actual job growth).\n\nSampling Distribution \nA sampling distribution is analogous to a population distribution: it describes the range of all possible values that the sampling statistic can take. In the assessment of the quality of a sample, the approach usually involves comparing the sampling distribution to the population distribution. We expect the sampling distribution to be a pattern similar to the population distribution - that is, if a population is normally distributed, the sample should also be normally distributed. If the sample is skewed when we were expecting a normal pattern with most of the observations centered around the mean, it indicates potential problems with the sample and/or the methodology.\n\nStratified Random Sampling.\nIn a stratified random approach, a population is first divided into subpopulations or strata, based upon one or more classification criteria. Within each stratum, a simple random sample is taken from those members (the members of the subpopulation). The number to be sampled from each stratum depends on its size relative to the population - that is, if a classification system results in three subgroups or strata, and Group A has 50% of the population, and Group B and Group C have 25% each, the sample we draw must conform to the same relative sizes (half of the sample from A, a quarter each from B and C). The samples taken from each strata are then pooled together to form the overall sample.\n\nThe table below illustrates a stratified approach to improving our economic research on current hiring expectations. In our earlier approach that randomly drew from all 500 companies, we may have accidentally drawn too heavily from a sector doing well, and under-represented other areas. In stratified random sampling, each of the 500 companies in the S&P 500 index is assigned to one of 12 sectors. Thus we have 12 strata, and our sample of 25 companies is based on drawing from each of the 12 strata, in proportions relative to the industry weights within the index. The S&P weightings are designed to replicate the domestic economy, which is why financial services and health care (which are relatively more important sectors in today's economy) are more heavily weighted than utilities. Within each sector, a random approach is used - for example, if there are 120 financial services companies and we need five financial companies for our research study, those five would be selected via a random draw, or by a systematic approach (i.e. every 24th company on an alphabetical list of the subgroup). \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSector\n\n\nPercent of\r\n\t\t\t\tS&P 500\n\n\nCompanies to sample\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\u00a0\n\n\nSector\n\n\nPercent of S&P 500\n\n\nCompanies to sample\n\n\n\n\nBusiness Svcs\n\n\n3.8%\n\n\n1\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\u00a0\n\n\nHealth Care\n\n\n13.6%\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\nConsumer Goods\n\n\n9.4%\n\n\n2\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\u00a0\n\n\nIdstrl Mtls.\n\n\n12.7%\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\nConsumer Svcs\n\n\n8.2%\n\n\n2\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\u00a0\n\n\nMedia\n\n\n3.7%\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\nEnergy\n\n\n8.5%\n\n\n2\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\u00a0\n\n\nSoftware\n\n\n3.9%\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\nFinancial Svcs\n\n\n20.1%\n\n\n5\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\u00a0\n\n\nTelecomm\n\n\n3.2%\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\nHardware\n\n\n9.4%\n\n\n2\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\u00a0\n\n\nUtilities\n\n\n3.4%\n\n\n1\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\u00a0\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\u00a0\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\u00a0\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\u00a0\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\u00a0\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\u00a0\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\u00a0\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nTime-Series Data \nTime series date refers to one variable taken over discrete, equally spaced periods of time. The distinguishing feature of a time series is that it draws back on history to show how one variable has changed. Common examples include historical quarterly returns on a stock or mutual fund for the last five years, earnings per share on a stock each quarter for the last ten years or fluctuations in the market-to-book ratio on a stock over a 20-year period. In every case, past time periods are examined.\n\nCross-Sectional Data \nCross section data typically focuses on one period of time and measures a particular variable across several companies or industries. A cross-sectional study could focus on quarterly returns for all large-cap value mutual funds in the first quarter of 2005, or this quarter's earnings-per-share estimates for all pharmaceutical firms, or differences in the current market-to-book ratio for the largest 100 firms traded on the NYSE. We can see that the actual variables being examined may be similar to a time-series analysis, with the difference being that a single time period is the focus, and several companies, funds, etc. are involved in the study. The earlier example of analyzing hiring plans at S&P 500 companies is a good example of cross-sectional research.\n\nThe Central Limit Theorem \nThe central limit theorem states that, for a population distribution with mean = \u03bc and a finite variance \u03c32, the sampling distribution will take on three important characteristics as the sample size becomes large: \n\n\nThe sample mean will be approximately normally distributed.\n\nThe sample mean will be equal to the population mean (\u03bc).\n\nThe sample variance will be equal to the population variance (\u03c32) divided by the size of the sample (n).\n\n\nThe first assumption - that the sample distribution will be normal - holds regardless of the distribution of the underlying population. Thus the central limit theorem can help make probability estimates for a sample of a non-normal population (e.g. skewed, lognormal), based on the fact that the sample mean for large sample sizes will be a normal distribution. This tendency toward normally distributed series for large samples gives the central limit theorem its most powerful attribute. The assumption of normality enables samples to be used in constructing confidence intervals and to test hypotheses, as we will find when covering those subjects.\n\nExactly how large is large in terms of creating a large sample? Remember the number 30. According to the reference text, that's the minimum number a sample must be before we can assume it is normally distributed. Don't be surprised if a question asks how large a sample should be - should it be 20, 30, 40, or 50? It's an easy way to test whether you've read the textbook, and if you remember 30, you score an easy correct answer.\n\nStandard Error\nThe standard error is the standard deviation of the sample statistic. Earlier, we indicated that the sample variance is the population variance divided by n (sample size). The formula for standard error was derived by taking the positive square root of the variance.\n\nIf the population standard deviation is given, standard error is calculated by this ratio: population standard deviation / square root of sample size, or \u03c3/(n)1/2. If population standard deviation is unknown, the sample standard deviation (s) is used to estimate it, and standard error = s/(n)1/2. Note that \"n\" in the denominator means that the standard error becomes smaller as the sample size becomes larger, an important property to remember.\n\nPoint Estimate vs. Confidence Interval Population Parameters\nA point estimate is one particular value that is used to estimate the underlying population parameter. For example, the sample mean is essentially a point estimate of a population mean. However, because of the presence of sampling error, sometimes it is more useful to start with this point estimate, and then establish a range of values both above and below the point estimate. Next, by using the probability-numbers characteristic of normally distributed variables, we can state the level of confidence we have that the actual population mean will fall somewhere in our range. This process is knows as \"constructing a confidence interval\".\n\nThe level of confidence we want to establish is given by the number \u03b1, or alpha, which is the probability that a point estimate will not fall in a confidence range. The lower the alpha, the more confident we want to be - e.g. alpha of 5% indicates we want to be 95% confident; 1% alpha indicates 99% confidence. \n\nProperties of an Estimator\nThe three desirable properties of an estimator are that they are unbiased, efficient and consistent:\n\n\nUnbiased - The expected value (mean) of the estimate's sampling distribution is equal to the underlying population parameter; that is, there is no upward or downward bias.\n\nEfficiency - While there are many unbiased estimators of the same parameter, the most efficient has a sampling distribution with the smallest variance.\n\nConsistency - Larger sample sizes tend to produce more accurate estimates; that is, the sample parameter converges on the population parameter.\n\nConstructing Confidence Intervals\nThe general structure for a (1 - \u03b1) confidence interval is given by:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormula 2.33\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere: the reliability factor increases as a function of an increasing confidence level. \n\nIn other words, if we want to be 99% confident that a parameter will fall within a range, we need to make that interval wider than we would if we wanted to be only 90% confident. The actual reliability factors used are derived from the standard normal distribution, or Z value, at probabilities of alpha/2 since the interval is two-tailed, or above and below a point.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDegrees of Freedom\nDegrees of freedom are used for determining the reliability-factor portion of the confidence interval with the t-distribution. In finding sample variance, for any sample size n, degrees of freedom = n -\r\n1. Thus for a sample size of 8, degrees of freedom are 7. For a sample size of 58, degrees of freedom are 57. The concept of degrees of freedom is taken from the fact that a sample variance is based on a series of observations, not all of which can be independently selected if we are to arrive at the true parameter. One observation essentially depends on all the other observations. In other words, if the sample size is 58, think of that sample of 58 in two parts: (a) 57 independent observations and (b) one dependent observation, on which the value is essentially a residual number based on the other observations. Taken together, we have our estimates for mean and variance. If degrees of freedom is 57, it means that we would be \"free\" to choose any 57 observations (i.e. sample size - 1), since there is always that 58th value that will result in a particular sample mean for the entire group. \n\nCharacteristic of the t-distribution is that additional degrees of freedom reduce the range of the confidence interval, and produce a more reliable estimate. Increasing degrees of freedom is done by increasing sample size. For larger sample sizes, use of the z-statistic is an acceptable alternative to the t-distribution - this is true since the z-statistic is based on the standard normal distribution, and the t-distribution moves closer to the standard normal at higher degrees of freedom.\n\nStudent's t-distribution\nStudent's t-distribution is a series of symmetrical distributions, each distribution defined by its degrees of freedom. All of the t-distributions appear similar in shape to a standard normal distribution, except that, compared to a standard normal curve, the t-distributions are less peaked and have fatter tails. With each increase in degrees of freedom, two properties change: (1) the distribution's peak increases (i.e. the probability that the estimate will be closer to the mean increases), and (2) the tails (in other words, the parts of the curve far away from the mean estimate) approach zero more quickly - i.e. there is a reduced probability of extreme values as we increase degrees of freedom. As degrees of freedom become very large - as they approach infinity - the t-distribution approximates the standard normal distribution.\n\nFigure 2.12: Student's t-distribution\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_52", "text": "\n\nSample Size\nIncreasing sample size benefits a research study by increasing the confidence and reliability of the confidence interval, and as a result, the precision with which the population parameter can be estimated. Other choices affect how wide or how narrow a confidence interval will be: choice of statistic, with t being wider/more conservative than z, as well as degree of confidence, with lesser degrees such as 90% resulting in wider/more conservative intervals than 99%. An increase in sample size tends to have an even more meaningful effect, due to the formula for standard error (i.e. the ratio of 'sample standard deviation / sample size1/2'), resulting in the fact that standard error varies inversely with sample size. As a result, more observations in the sample (all other factors equal) improve the quality of a research study.\n\nAt the same time, two other factors tend to make larger sample sizes less desirable. The first consideration, which primarily affects time-series data, is that population parameters have a tendency to change over time. For example, if we are studying a mutual fund and using five years of quarterly returns in our analysis (i.e. sample size of 20, 5 years x 4 quarters a year). The resulting confidence interval appears too wide so in an effort to increase precision, we use 20 years of data (80 observations). However, when we reach back into the 1980s to study this fund, it had a different fund manager, plus it was buying more small-cap value companies, whereas today it is a blend of growth and value, with mid to large market caps. In addition, the factors affecting today's stock market (and mutual fund returns) are much different compared to back in the 1980s. In short, the population parameters have changed over time, and data from 20 years ago shouldn't be mixed with data from the most recent five years.\n\nThe other consideration is that increasing sample size can involve additional expenses. Take the example of researching hiring plans at S&P 500 firms (cross-sectional research). A sample size of 25 was suggested, which would involve contacting the human resources department of 25 firms. By increasing the sample size to 100, or 200 or higher, we do achieve stronger precision in making our conclusions, but at what cost? In many cross-sectional studies, particularly in the real world, where each sample takes time and costs money, it's sufficient to leave sample size at a certain lower level, as the additional precision isn't worth the additional cost.\n\nData Mining Bias\nData mining is the practice of searching through historical data in an effort to find significant patterns, with which researchers can build a model and make conclusions on how this population will behave in the future. For example, the so-called January effect, where stock market returns tend to be stronger in the month of January, is a product of data mining: monthly returns on indexes going back 50 to 70 years were sorted and compared against one another, and the patterns for the month of January were noted. Another well-known conclusion from data mining is the 'Dogs of the Dow' strategy: each January, among the 30 companies in the Dow industrials, buy the 10 with the highest dividend yields. Such a strategy outperforms the market over the long run.\n\nBookshelves are filled with hundreds of such models that \"guarantee\" a winning investment strategy. Of course, to borrow a common industry phrase, \"past performance does not guarantee future results\". Data-mining bias refers to the errors that result from relying too heavily on data-mining practices. In other words, while some patterns discovered in data mining are potentially useful, many others might just be coincidental and are not likely to be repeated in the future - particularly in an \"efficient\" market. For example, we may not be able to continue to profit from the January effect going forward, given that this phenomenon is so widely recognized. As a result, stocks are bid for higher in November and December by market participants anticipating the January effect, so that by the start of January, the effect is priced into stocks and one can no longer take advantage of the model. Intergenerational data mining refers to the continued use of information already put forth in prior financial research as a guide for testing the same patterns and overstating the same conclusions. \n\nDistinguishing between valid models and valid conclusions, and those ideas that are purely coincidental and the product of data mining, presents a significant challenge as data mining is often not easy to discover. A good start to investigate for its presence is to conduct an out-of-sample test - in other words, researching whether the model actually works for periods that do not overlap the time frame of the study. A valid model should continue to be statistically significant even when out-of-model tests are conducted. For research that is the product of data mining, a test outside of the model's time frame can often reveal its true nature. Other warning signs involve the number of patterns or variables examined in the research - that is, did this study simply search enough variables until something (anything) was finally discovered? Most academic research won't disclose the number of variables or patterns tested in the study, but oftentimes there are verbal hints that can reveal the presence of excessive data mining. \n\nAbove all, it helps when there is an economic rationale to explain why a pattern exists, as opposed to simply pointing out that a pattern is there. For example, years ago a research study discovered that the market tended to have positive returns in years that the NFC wins the Super Bowl, yet it would perform relatively poorly when the AFC representative triumphs. However, there's no economic rationale for explaining why this pattern exists - do people spend more, or companies build more, or investors invest more, based on the winner of a football game? Yet the story is out there every Super Bowl week. Patterns discovered as a result of data mining may make for interesting reading, but in the process of making decisions, care must be taken to ensure that mined patterns not be blindly overused.\n\nSample Selection Bias\nMany additional biases can adversely affect the quality and the usefulness of financial research. Sample-selection bias refers to the tendency to exclude a certain part of a population simply because the data is not available. As a result, we cannot state that the sample we've drawn is completely random - it is random only within the subset on which historic data could be obtained.\n\nSurvivorship Bias\nA common form of sample-selection bias in financial databases is survivorship bias, or the tendency for financial and accounting databases to exclude information on companies, mutual funds, etc. that are no longer in existence. As a result, certain conclusions can be made that may in fact be overstated were one to remove this bias and include all members of the population. For example, many studies have pointed out the tendency of companies with low price-to-book-value ratios to outperform those firms with higher P/BVs. However, these studies most likely aren't going to include those firms that have failed; thus data is not available and there is sample-selection bias. In the case of low and high P/BV, it stands to reason that companies in the midst of declining and failing will probably be relatively low on the P/BV scale yet, based on the research, we would be guided to buy these very same firms due to the historical pattern. It's likely that the gap between returns on low-priced (value) stocks and high-priced (growth) stocks has been systematically overestimated as a result of survivorship bias. Indeed, the investment industry has developed a number of growth and value indexes. However, in terms of defining for certain which strategy (growth or value) is superior, the actual evidence is mixed. \n\nSample selection bias extends to newer asset classes such as hedge funds, a heterogeneous group that is somewhat more removed from regulation, and where public disclosure of performance is much more discretionary compared to that of mutual funds or registered advisors of separately managed accounts. One suspects that hedge funds will disclose only the data that makes the fund look good (self-selection bias), compared to a more developed industry of mutual funds where the underperformers are still bound by certain disclosure requirements. \n\nLook-Ahead Bias\nResearch is guilty of look-ahead bias if is makes use of information that was not actually available on a particular day, yet the researchers assume it was. Let's returning to the example of buying low price-to-book-value companies; the research may assume that we buy our low P/BV portfolio on Jan 1 of a given year, and then (compared to a high P/BV portfolio) hold it throughout the year. Unfortunately, while a firm's current stock price is immediately available, the book value of the firm is generally not available until months after the start of the year, when the firm files its official 10-K. To overcome this bias, one could construct P/BV ratios using current price divided by the previous year's book value, or (as is done by Russell's indexes) wait until midyear to rebalance after data is reported.\n\nTime-Period Bias \nThis type of bias refers to an investment study that may appear to work over a specific time frame but may not last in future time periods. For example, any research done in 1999 or 2000 that covered a trailing five-year period may have touted the outperformance of high-risk growth strategies, while pointing to the mediocre results of more conservative approaches. When these same studies are conducted today for a trailing 10-year period, the conclusions might be quite different. Certain anomalies can persist for a period of several quarters or even years, but research should ideally be tested in a number of different business cycles and market environments in order to ensure that the conclusions aren't specific to one unique period or environment.\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_53", "text": "\n        When population variance (\u03c32) is known, the z-statistic can be used to calculate a reliability factor. Relative to the t-distribution, it will result in tighter confidence intervals and more reliable estimates of mean and standard deviation. Z-values are based on the standard normal distribution.\n\r\nFor establishing confidence intervals when the population variance is known, the interval is constructed with this formula:\n\r\n\t\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nFormula 2.34\n\n\n\n\n\r\nFor alpha of 5% (i.e. a 95% confidence interval), the reliability factor (Z\u03b1/2) is 1.96, but for a CFA exam problem, it is usually sufficient to round to an even 2 to solve the problem. (Remember that z-value at 95% confidence is 2, as tables for z-values are sometimes not provided!) Given a sample size of 16, a sample mean of 20 and population standard deviation of 25, a 95% confidence interval would be 20 + 2*(25/(16)1/2) = 20 + 2*(25/4) = 20 + 12.5. In short, for this sample size and for these sample statistics, we would be 95% confident that the actual population mean would fall in a range from 7.5 to 32.5.\n\r\nSuppose that this 7.5-to-32.5 range was deemed too broad for our purposes. Reducing the confidence interval is accomplished in two ways: (1) increasing sample size, and (2) decreasing our allowable level of confidence.\n\r\n1. Increasing sample size from 16 to 100 - Our 95% confidence is now equal to 20 + 2*(25/(100)1/2) = 20 + 2*(25/10) = 20 + 5. In other words, increasing the sample size to 100 narrows the 95% confidence range: min 15 to max 25.\n\r\n2. Using 90% confidence - Our interval is now equal to 20 + 1.65*(25/(100)1/2) = 20 + 1.65*(25/10) = 20 + 4.125. In other words, decreasing the percentage confidence to 90% reduces the range: min 15.875 to max 24.125.\n\r\nWhen population variance is unknown, we will need to use the t-distribution to establish confidence intervals. The t-statistic is more conservative; that is, it results in broader intervals. Assume the following sample statistics: sample size = 16, sample mean = 20, sample standard deviation = 25.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nTo use the t-distribution, we must first calculate degrees of freedom, which for sample size 16 is equal to n - 1 = 15. Using an alpha of 5% (95% confidence interval), our confidence interval is 20 + (2.131) * (25/161/2), which gives a range minimum of 6.68 and a range maximum of 33.32.\n\r\nAs before, we can reduce this range with (1) larger samples and/or (2) reducing allowable degree of confidence:\n\r\n1. Increase sample size from 16 to 100 - The range is now equal to 20 + 2 * (25/10) \u00e0 minimum 15 and maximum 25 (for large sample sizes the t-distribution is sufficiently close to the z-value that it becomes an acceptable alternative).\n\r\n2. Reduce confidence from 95% to 90% - The range is now equal to 20 + 1.65 * (25/10) \u00e0 minimum 15.875 and maximum 24.125.\n\nLarge Sample Size\r\nIn our earlier discussion on the central limit theorem, we stated that large samples will tend to be normally distributed even when the underlying population is non-normal. Moreover, at sufficiently large samples, where there are enough degrees of freedom, the z and t statistics will provide approximately the same reliability factor so we can default to the standard normal distribution and the z-statistic. The structure for the confidence interval is similar to our previous examples.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nFor a 95% confidence interval, if sample size = 100, sample standard deviation = 10 and our point estimate is 15, the confidence interval is 15 + 2* (10/1001/2) or 15 + 2. We are 95% confident that the population mean will fall between 13 and 17.\n\r\nSuppose we wanted to construct a 99% confidence interval. Reliability factor now becomes 2.58 and we have 15 + 2.58*(10/1001/2) or 15 + 2.58, or a minimum of 12.42 and a maximum of 17.58.\n\r\nThe table below summarizes the statistics used in constructing confidence intervals, given various situations:\r\n\r\n\t\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nDistribution\n\n\nPopulation Variance\n\n\nSample Size\n\n\nAppropriate Statistic\n\n\n\n\nNormal\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\tKnown\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\tSmall\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\tz\n\n\n\n\nNormal\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\tKnown\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\tLarge\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\tz\n\n\n\n\nNormal\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\tUnknown\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\tSmall\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\tt\n\n\n\n\nNormal\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\tUnknown\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\tLarge\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\tt or z\n\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\tNon-Normal\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\tKnown\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\tSmall\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\tunavailable\n\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\tNon-Normal\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\tKnown\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\tLarge\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\tz\n\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\tNon-Normal\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\tUnknown\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\tSmall\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\tunavailable\n\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\tNon-Normal\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\tUnknown\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\tLarge\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\tt or z\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExam Tips and Tricks\r\n\t\t\t\tWhile these calculations don\\'t seem difficult, it\\'s true that this material seems at times to run together, particularly if a CFA candidate has never used it or hasn\\'t studied it in some time. While not likely to be a major point of emphasis, expect at least a few questions on confidence intervals and in particular, a case study that will test basic knowledge of definitions, or that will compare/contrast the two statistics presented (t-distribution and z-value) to make sure you know which is useful in a given application. More than anything, the idea is to introduce confidence intervals and how they are constructed as a prerequisite for hypothesis testing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_54", "text": "\nHypothesis testing provides a basis for taking ideas or theories that someone initially develops about the economy or investing or markets, and then deciding whether these ideas are true or false. More precisely, hypothesis testing helps decide whether the tested ideas are probably true or probably false as the conclusions made with the hypothesis-testing process are never made with 100% confidence - which we found in the sampling and estimating process: we have degrees of confidence - e.g. 95% or 99% - but not absolute certainty. Hypothesis testing is often associated with the procedure for acquiring and developing knowledge known as the scientific method. As such, it relates the fields of investment and economic research (i.e., business topics) to other traditional branches of science (mathematics, physics, medicine, etc.)\n\nHypothesis testing is similar in some respects to the estimation processes presented in the previous section. Indeed, the field of statistical inference, where conclusions on a population are drawn from observing subsets of the larger group, is generally divided into two groups: estimation and hypothesis testing. With estimation, the focus was on answering (with a degree of confidence) the value of a parameter, or else a range within which the parameter most likely falls. Think of estimating as working from general to specific. With hypothesis testing, the focus is shifted: we start my making a statement about the parameter's value, and then the question becomes whether the statement is true or not true. In other words, it starts with a specific value and works the other way to make a general statement. \n\nWhat is a Hypothesis?\nA hypothesis is a statement made about a population parameter. These are typical hypotheses: \"the mean annual return of this mutual fund is greater than 12%\", and \"the mean return is greater than the average return for the category\". Stating the hypothesis is the initial step in a defined seven-step process for hypothesis testing - a process developed based on the scientific method. We indicate each step below. In the remainder of this section of the study guide, we develop a detailed explanation for how to answer each step's question.\n\nHypothesis testing seeks to answer seven questions:\n\n\nWhat are the null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis?\n\nWhich test statistic is appropriate, and what is the probability distribution?\n\nWhat is the required level of significance?\n\nWhat is the decision rule?\n\nBased on the sample data, what is the value of the test statistic?\n\nDo we reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis?\n\nBased on our rejection or inability to reject, what is our investment or economic decision?\n\nNull Hypothesis\nStep #1 in our process involves stating the null and alternate hypothesis. The null hypothesis is the statement that will be tested. The null hypothesis is usually denoted with \"H0\". For investment and economic research applications, and as it relates to the CFA exam, the null hypothesis will be a statement on the value of a population parameter, usually the mean value if a question relates to return, or the standard deviation if it relates to risk. It can also refer to the value of any random variable (e.g. sales at company XYZ are at least $10 million this quarter). In hypothesis testing, the null hypothesis is initially regarded to be true, until (based on our process) we gather enough proof to either reject the null hypothesis, or fail to reject the null hypothesis. \n\nAlternative Hypothesis\nThe alternative hypothesis is a statement that will be accepted as a result of the null hypothesis being rejected. The alternative hypothesis is usually denoted \"Ha\". In hypothesis testing, we do not directly test the worthiness of the alternate hypothesis, as our testing focus is on the null. Think of the alternative hypothesis as the residual of the null - for example, if the null hypothesis states that sales at company XYZ are at least $10 million this quarter, the alternative hypothesis to this null is that sales will fail to reach the $10 million mark. Between the null and the alternative, it is necessary to account for all possible values of a parameter. In other words, if we gather evidence to reject this null hypothesis, then we must necessarily accept the alternative. If we fail to reject the null, then we are rejecting the alternative.\n\nOne-Tailed Test\nThe labels \"one-tailed\" and \"two-tailed\" refer to the standard normal distribution (as well as all of the t-distributions). The key words for identifying a one-tailed test are \"greater than or less than\". For example, if our hypothesis is that the annual return on this mutual fund will be greater than 8%, it's a one-tailed test that will be rejected based only on finding observations in the left tail. \n\nFigure 2.13 below illustrates a one-tailed test for \"greater than\" (rejection in left tail). (A one-tailed test for \"less than\" would look similar to the graph below, with the rejection region for less than in the right tail rather than the left.) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo-Tailed test\nCharacterized by the words \"equal to or not equal to\". For example, if our hypothesis were that the return on a mutual fund is equal to 8%, we could reject it based on observations in either tail (sufficiently higher than 8% or sufficiently lower than 8%). \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChoosing the null and the alternate hypothesis:\nIf \u03b8 (theta) is the actual value of a population parameter (e.g. mean or standard deviation), and \u03b80 (theta subzero) is the value of theta according to our hypothesis, the null and alternative hypothesis can be formed in three different ways:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChoosing what will be the null and what will be the alternative depends on the case and what it is we wish to prove. We usually have two different approaches to what we could make the null and alternative, but in most cases, it's preferable to make the null what we believe we can reject, and then attempt to reject it. For example, in our case of a one-tailed test with the return hypothesized to be greater than 8%, we could make the greater-than case the null (alternative being less than), or we could make the greater-than case the alternative (with less than the null). Which should we choose? A hypothesis test is typically designed to look for evidence that may possibly reject the null. So in this case, we would make the null hypothesis \"the return is less than or equal to 8%\", which means we are looking for observations in the left tail. If we reject the null, then the alternative is true, and we conclude the fund is likely to return at least 8%.\n\nTest Statistic\nStep #2 in our seven-step process involves identifying an appropriate test statistic. In hypothesis testing, a test statistic is defined as a quantity taken from a sample that is used as the basis for testing the null hypothesis (rejecting or failing to reject the null).\n\nCalculating a test statistic will vary based upon the case and our choice of probability distribution (for example, t-test, z-value). The general format of the calculation is:\n\n\n\n\n\nFormula 2.36\nTest statistic = (sample statistic) - (value of parameter according to null)\n(Standard error of sample statistic)\n\n\n\n\nType I and Type II Errors\nStep #3 in hypothesis testing involves specifying the significance level of our hypothesis test. The significance level is similar in concept to the confidence level associated with estimating a parameter - both involve choosing the probability of making an error (denoted by \u03b1, or alpha), with lower alphas reducing the percentage probability of error. In the case of estimators, the tradeoff of reducing this error was to accept a wider (less precise) confidence interval. In the case of hypothesis testing, choosing lower alphas also involves a tradeoff - in this case, increasing a second type of error.\n\nErrors in hypothesis testing come in two forms: Type I and Type II. A type I error is defined as rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true. A type II error is defined as not rejecting the null hypothesis when it is false. As the table below indicates, these errors represent two of the four possible outcomes of a hypothesis test:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe reason for separating type I and type II errors is that, depending on the case, there can be serious consequences for a type I error, and there are other cases when type II errors need to be avoided, and it is important to understand which type is more important to avoid.\n\nSignificance Level\nDenoted by \u03b1, or alpha, the significance level is the probability of making a type I error, or the probability that we will reject the null hypothesis when it is true. So if we choose a significance level of 0.05, it means there is a 5% chance of making a type I error. A 0.01 significance level means there is just a 1% chance of making a type I error. As a rule, a significance level is specified prior to calculating the test statistic, as the analyst conducting the research may use the result of the test statistic calculation to impact the choice of significance level (may prompt a change to higher or lower significance). Such a change would take away from the objectivity of the test.\n\nWhile any level of alpha is permissible, in practice there is likely to be one of three possibilities for significance level: 0.10 (semi-strong evidence for rejecting the null hypothesis), 0.05 (strong evidence), and 0.01 (very strong evidence). Why wouldn't't we always opt for 0.01 or even lower probabilities of type I errors - isn't the idea to reduce and eliminate errors? In hypothesis testing, we have to control two types of errors, with a tradeoff that when one type is reduced, the other type is increased. In other words, by lowering the chances of a type I error, we must reject the null less frequently - including when it is false (a type II error). Actually quantifying this tradeoff is impossible because the probability of a type II error (denoted by \u03b2, or beta) is not easy to define (i.e. it changes for each value of \u03b8). Only by increasing sample size can we reduce the probability of both types of errors.\n\nDecision Rule\nStep #4 in the hypothesis-testing process requires stating a decision rule. This rule is crafted by comparing two values: (1) the result of the calculated value of the test statistic, which we will complete in step #5 and (2) a rejection point, or critical value (or values) that is (are) the function of our significance level and the probability distribution being used in the test. If the calculated value of the test statistic is as extreme (or more extreme) than the rejection point, then we reject the null hypothesis, and state that the result is statistically significant. Otherwise, if the test statistic does not reach the rejection point, then we cannot reject the null hypothesis and we state that the result is not statistically significant. A rejection point depends on the probability distribution, on the chosen alpha, and on whether the test in one-tailed or two-tailed. \n\nFor example, if in our case we are able to use the standard normal distribution (the z-value), if we choose an alpha of 0.05, and we have a two-tailed test (i.e. reject the null hypothesis when the test statistic is either above or below), the two rejection points are taken from the z-values for standard normal distributions: below -1.96 and above +1.96. Thus if the calculated test statistic is in these two rejection ranges, the decision would be to reject the null hypothesis. Otherwise, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. \n\n\n\n\n\nLook Out!\n\r\n\t\t\t\tTraditionally, it was said that we accepted the null hypothesis; however, the authors have discouraged use of the word \"accept\", in terms of accepting the null hypothesis, as those terms imply a greater degree of conviction about the null than is warranted. Having made the effort to make this distinction, do not be surprised if this subtle change (which seems inconsequential on the surface) somehow finds its way onto the CFA exam (if you answer \"accept the null hypothesis\", you get the question wrong, and if you answer \"fail to reject the null hypothesis\" you score points.\n\n\n\n\nPower of a Test\nThe power of a hypothesis test refers to the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis. There are two possible outcomes when the null hypothesis is false: either we (1) reject it (as we correctly should) or (2) we accept it - and make a type II error. Thus the power of a test is also equivalent to 1 minus the beta (\u03b2), the probability of a type II error. Since beta isn't quantified, neither is the power of a test. For hypothesis tests, it is sufficient to specify significance level, or alpha. However, given a choice between more than one test statistic (for example, z-test, t-test), we will always choose the test that increases a test's power, all other factors equal.\n\nConfidence Intervals vs. Hypothesis Tests\r\nConfidence intervals, as a basis for estimating population parameters, were constructed as a function of \"number of standard deviations away from the mean\". For example, for 95% confidence that our interval will include the population mean (\u03bc), when we use the standard normal distribution (z-statistic), the interval is: (sample mean) \u00b1 1.96 * (standard error), or, equivalently,-1.96*(standard error) < (sample mean) < +1.96*(standard error).\n\nHypothesis tests, as a basis for testing the value of population parameters, are also set up to reject or not reject based on \"number of standard deviations away from the mean\". The basic structure for testing the null hypothesis at the 5% significance level, again using the standard normal, is -1.96 < [(sample mean - hypothesized population mean) / standard error] < +1.96, or, equivalently,-1.96 * (std. error) < (sample mean) - (hypo. pop. mean) < +1.96 * (std. error).\n\nIn hypothesis testing, we essentially create an interval within which the null will not be rejected, and we are 95% confident in this interval (i.e. there's a 5% chance of a type I error). By slightly rearranging terms, the structure for a confidence interval and the structure for rejecting/not rejecting a null hypothesis appear very similar - an indication of the relationship between the concepts.\n\nMaking a Statistical Decision\nStep #6 in hypothesis testing involves making the statistical decision, which actually compares the test statistic to the value computed as the rejection point; that is, it carries out the decision rule created in step #4. For example, with a significance level of 0.05, using the standard normal distribution, on a two-tailed test (i.e. null is \"equal to\"; alternative is not equal to), we have rejection points below -1.96 and above +1.96. If our calculated test statistic\r\n[(sample mean - hypothesized mean) / standard error] = 0.6, then we cannot reject the null hypothesis. If the calculated value is 3.6, we reject the null hypothesis and accept the alternative.\n\nThe final step, or step #7, involves making the investment or economic decision (i.e. the real-world decision). In this context, the statistical decision is but one of many considerations. For example, take a case where we created a hypothesis test to determine whether a mutual fund outperformed its peers in a statistically significant manner. For this test, the null hypothesis was that the fund's mean annual return was less than or equal to a category average; the alternative was that it was greater than the average. Assume that at a significance level of 0.05, we were able to establish statistical significance and reject the null hypothesis, thus accepting the alternative. In other words, our statistical decision was that this fund would outperform peers, but what is the investment decision? The investment decision would likely take into account (for example) the risk tolerance of the client and the volatility (risk) measures of the fund, and it would assess whether transaction costs and tax implications make the investment decision worth making. In other words, rejecting/not rejecting a null hypothesis does not automatically require that a decision be carried out; thus there is the need to assess the statistical decision and the economic or investment decision in two separate steps.\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_55", "text": "\nResults Where Data is Normally Distributed and Variance is Known or Unknown\n\n\nWhenever variance of a population (\u03c32) is known, the z-test is the preferred alternative to test a hypothesis of the population mean (\u03bc). To compute the test statistic, standard error is equal to population standard deviation / sq. root of sample size. For example, with a population variance of 64 and a sample size of 25, standard error is equal to (64)1/2/(25)1/2, or 1.6.\n\nExample: Test Statistic\r\n\t\tSuppose that in this same case we have constructed a hypothesis test that the mean annual return is equal to 12%; that is, we have a two-tailed test, where the null hypothesis is that the population mean = 12, and the alternate is that it is not equal to 12. Using a 0.05 critical level (0.025 for each tail), our rule is to reject the null when the test statistic is either below -1.96 or above +1.96 (at p = .025, z = 1.96). Suppose sample mean = 10.6. \n\nAnswer:\nTest statistic = (10.6 - 12)/1.6 = -1.4/1.6 = -0.875. This value does not fall below the rejection point, so we cannot reject the null hypothesis with statistical certainty.\n\n\nWhen we are making hypothesis tests on a population mean, it's relatively likely that the population variance will be unknown. In these cases, we use a sample standard deviation when computing standard error, and the t-statistic for the decision rule (i.e. as the source for our rejection level). Compared to the z or standard normal, a t-statistic is more conservative (i.e. higher rejection points for rejecting the null hypothesis). In cases with large sample sizes (at least 30), the z-statistic may be substituted.\n\nExample:\nTake a case where sample size is 16. In this case, the t-stat is the only appropriate choice. For the t-distribution, degrees of freedom are calculated as (sample size - 1), df = 15 in this example. In this case, assume we are testing a hypothesis that a population mean is greater than 8, so this will be a one-tailed test (right tail): null hypothesis is \u03bc < 8, and the alternative is that \u03bc > 8. Our required significance level is 0.05. Using the table for Student's t-distribution for df = 15 and p = 0.05, the critical value (rejection point) is 1.753. In other words, if our calculated test statistic is greater than 1.753, we reject the null hypothesis.\n\nAnswer:\nMoving to step 5 of the hypothesis-testing process, we take a sample where the mean is 8.3 and the standard deviation is 6.1. For this sample, standard error = s /n1/2 = 6.1/(16)1/2 = 6.1/4 = 1.53. The test statistic is (8.3 - 8.0)/1.53 = 0.3/1.53, or 0.196. Comparing 0.196 to our rejection point of 1.753, we are unable to reject the null hypothesis. \n\nNote that in this case, our sample mean of 8.3 was actually greater than 8; however, the hypothesis test is set up to require statistical significance, not simply compare a sample mean to the hypothesis. In other words, the decisions made in hypothesis testing are also a function of sample size (which at 16 is low), the standard deviation, the required level of significance and the t-distribution. Our interpretation in this example is that the 8.3 from the sample mean, while nominally higher than 8, simply isn't significantly higher than 8, at least to the point where we would be able to definitively make a conclusion regarding the population mean being greater than 8.\n\n\nRelative equality of population means of two normally distributed populations, where independent random sample assumed variances are equal or unequal \nFor the case where the population variances for two separate groups can be assumed to be equal, a technique for pooling an estimate of population variance (s2) from the sample data is given by the following formula (assumes two independent random samples):\n\n\n\n\n\nFormula 2.37\n\n\n\nWhere: n1, n2 are samples sizes, and s12, s22 are sample variances.\r\n\t\t\t\tDegrees of freedom = n1 + n2 - 2\n\n\n\n\nFor testing equality of two population means (i.e. \u03bc1 = \u03bc2), the test statistic calculates the difference in sample means (X1 - X2), divided by the standard error: the square root of (s2/n1 + s2/n2).\n\nExample: Population Means\nAssume that the pooled estimate of variance (s2) was 40 and sample size for each group was 20. Standard error = (40/20 + 40/20)1/2 = (80/20) \u00bd = 2.\n\nAnswer:\nIf sample means were 8.6 and 8.9, the t = (8.6 - 8.9)/2 = -0.3/2 = -0.15. Tests of equality/inequality are two-sided tests. With df = 38 (sum of samples sizes - 2) and if we assume 0.05 significance (p = 0.025), the rejection level is t < -2.024, or t > +2.024. Since our computed test statistic was -0.15, we cannot reject the null hypothesis that these population means are equal.\n\n1. For hypothesis tests of equal population means where variances cannot be assumed to be equal, the appropriate test statistic for the hypothesis is the t-stat, but we can no longer pool an estimate of standard deviation, and the standard error becomes the square root of [(s12/n1) + (s22/n2)]. The null hypothesis remains \u03bc1 = \u03bc2, and the test statistic is calculated similar to the previous example (i.e. difference in sample means / standard error). Computing degrees of freedom is approximated by this formula\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLook Out!\r\n\t\t\t\tNote: Don\\'t spend time memorizing this formula; it won\\'t be required for the exam. Focus instead on the steps of hypothesis testing and interpreting results.\n\n\n\n\nThe Paired-Comparisons Test\nThe previous example tested the equality or inequality of two population means, with a key assumption that the two populations were independent of each other. In a paired-comparisons test, the two populations have some degree of correlation or co-movement, and the calculation of test statistic takes account of this correlation.\n\nTake a case where we are comparing two mutual funds that are both classified as large-cap growth, in which we are testing whether returns for one are significantly above the other (statistically significant). The paired- comparisons test is appropriate since we assume some degree of correlation, as returns for each will be dependent on the market. To calculate the t-statistic, we first find the sample mean difference, denoted by d:\n\nd = (1/n)(d1 + d2 + d3 .... + dn), where n is the number of paired observations (in our example, the number of quarters for which we have quarterly returns), and each d is the difference between each observation in the sample. Next, sample variance, or (sum of all deviations from d )2/(n - 1) is calculated, with standard deviation (sd) the positive square root of the variance. Standard error = sd/(n)1/2. \n\nFor our mutual example, if our mean returns are for 10 years (40 quarters of data), have a sample mean difference of 2.58, and a sample standard deviation of 5.32, our test statistic is computed as (2.58)/((5.32)/(40)1/2), or 3.067. At 49 degrees of freedom with a 0.05 significance level, the rejection point is 2.01. Thus we reject the null hypothesis and state that there is a statistically significant difference in returns between these funds.\n\nHypothesis Tests on the Variance of a Normally Distributed Population\nHypothesis tests concerning the value of a variance (\u03c32) start by formulating the null and alternative hypotheses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn hypothesis tests for the variance on a single normally distributed population, the appropriate test statistic is known as a \"chi-square\", denoted by \u03c72. Unlike the distributions we have been using previously, the chi-square is asymmetrical as it is bound on the left by zero. (This must be true since variance is always a positive number.) The chi-square is actually a family of distributions similar to the t-distributions, with different degrees of freedom resulting in a different chi-square distribution. \n\n\n\n\nFormula 2.38\nThe test statistic is \u03c72 = (n - 1)*s2 \n\u03c302 \n\n\n\n\nWhere: n = sample size, s2 = sample variance, \u03c302 = population variance from hypothesis \n\nSample variance s2 is refereed to as the sum of deviations between observed values and sample mean2, degrees of freedom, or n - 1\n\nExample: Hypothesis Testing w/ Chi Squared Statistic\nTo illustrate a hypothesis test using the chi-square statistic, take an example of a fund that we believe has been very volatile relative to the market, and we wish to prove that level of risk (as measured by quarterly standard deviation) is greater than the market's average. For our test, we assume the market's quarterly standard deviation is 10%.\n\nOur test will examine quarterly returns over the past five years, so n = 20, and degrees of freedom = 19. Our test is a greater-than test with the null hypothesis of \u03c32 < (10)2, or 100, and an alternate hypothesis of \u03c32 > 100. Using a 0.05 level of significance, our rejection point, from the chi-square tables with df = 19 and p = 0.05 in the right tail, is 30.144. Thus if our calculated test statistic is greater than 30.144, we reject the null hypothesis at 5% level of significance.\n\nAnswer:\nExamining the quarterly returns for this period, we find our sample variance (s2) is 135. With n = 20 and \u03c302 = 100, we have all the data required to calculate the test statistic.\n\n\u03c72 = ((n - 1)*s2)/\u03c302 = ((20 - 1)*135)/100 = 2565/100 or 25.65. \n\nSince 25.65 is less than our critical value of 30.144, we do not have enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis. While this fund may indeed be quite volatile, its volatility isn't statistically more meaningful than the market average for the period.\n\nHypothesis Tests Relating to the equality of the Variances of Two Normally Distributed Populations, where both Samples are Random and Independent\nFor hypothesis tests concerning relative values of the variances from two populations - whether \u03c312 (variance of the first population) and \u03c322 (variance of the second) are equal/not equal/greater than/less than - we can construct hypotheses in one of three ways.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen a hypothesis test compares variances from two populations and we can assume that random samples from the populations are independent (uncorrelated), the appropriate test is the F-test, which represents the ratio of sample variances. As with the chi-square, the F-distribution is a family of asymmetrical distributions (bound on the left by zero). The F-family of distributions is defined by two values of degrees of freedom: the numerator (df1) and denominator (df2). Each of the degrees of freedom are taken from the sample sizes (each sample size - 1). \n\nThe F-test taken from the sample data could be either s12/s22, or s22/s12 - with the convention to use whichever ratio produces the larger number. This way, the F-test need only be concerned with values greater than 1, since one of the two ratios is always going to be a number above 1.\n\nExample: Hypothesis Testing w/ Ratio of Sample Variances\nTo illustrate, take a case of two mutual funds. Fund A has enjoyed greater performance returns than Fund B (which we've owned, unfortunately). Our hypothesis is that the level of risk between these two is actually quite similar, meaning the Fund A has superior risk-adjusted results. We test the hypothesis for the past five years of quarterly data (df is 19 for both numerator and denominator). Using 0.05 significance, our critical value from the F-tables is 2.51. Assume from the five-year sample that quarterly standard deviations have been 8.5 for Fund A, and 6.3 for Fund B. \n\nAnswer:\nOur F-statistic is (8.5)2/(6.3)2 = 72.25/39.69 = 1.82. \n\nSince 1.82 does not reach the rejection level of 2.51, we cannot reject the null hypothesis, and we state that the risk between these funds is not significantly different.\n\nConcepts from the hypothesis-testing section are unlikely to be tested by rigorous exercises in number crunching but rather in identifying the unique attributes of a given statistic. For example, a typical question might ask, \"In hypothesis testing, which test statistic is defined by two degrees of freedom, the numerator and the denominator?\", giving you these choices: A. t-test, B. z-test, C. chi-square, or D. F-test. Of course, the answer would be D. Another question might ask, \"Which distribution is NOT symmetrical?\", and then give you these choices: A. t, B. z, C. chi-square, D. normal. Here the answer would be C. Focus on the defining characteristics, as they are the most likely source of exam questions. \n\nParametric and Nonparametric Tests\nAll of the hypothesis tests described thus far have been designed, in one way or another, to test the predicted value of one or more parameters - unknown variables such as mean and variance that characterize a population and whose observed values are distributed in a certain assumed way. Indeed, these specific assumptions are mandatory and also very important: most of the commonly applied tests are built with data that assumes the underlying population is normally distributed, which if not true, invalidates the conclusions reached. The less normal the population (i.e. the more skewed the data), the less these parametric tests or procedures should be used for the intended purpose. \n\nNonparametric hypothesis tests are designed for cases where either (a) fewer or different assumptions about the population data are appropriate, or (b) where the hypothesis test is not concerned with a population parameter.\n\nIn many cases, we are curious about a set of data but believe that the required assumptions (for example, normally distributed data) do not apply to this example, or else the sample size is too small to comfortably make such an assumption. A number of nonparametric alternatives have been developed to use in such cases. The table below indicates a few examples that are analogous to common parametric tests.\n\n\n\n\n\nConcern of hypothesis\n\nParametric test\n\nNonparametric\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\tSingle mean\n\r\n\t\t\t\tt-test, z-test\n\r\n\t\t\t\tWilcoxian signed-rank test\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\tDifferences between means\n\r\n\t\t\t\tt-test (or approximate t-test)\n\r\n\t\t\t\tMann-Whitney U-test\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\tPaired comparisons\n\r\n\t\t\t\tt-test\n\r\n\t\t\t\tSign test, or Wilcoxian\n\n\n\n\nSource: DeFusco, McLeavey, Pinto, Runkle, Quantitative Methods for Investment Analysis, 2nd edition, Chapter 7, p 357.\n\n\n\n\nA number of these tests are constructed by first converting data into ranks (first, second, third, etc.) and then fitting the data into the test. One such test applied to testing correlation (the degree to which two variables are related to each other) is the Spearman rank correlation coefficient. The Spearman test is useful in cases where a normal distribution cannot be assumed - usually when a variable is bound by zero (always positive), or where the range of values are limited. For the Spearman test, each observation in the two variables is ranked from largest to smallest, and then the differences between the ranks are measured. The data is then used to find the test statistic rs: 1 - [6*(sum of squared differences)/n*(n2 - 1)]. This result is compared to a rejection point (based on the Spearman rank correlation) to determine whether to reject or not reject the null hypothesis.\n\nAnother situation requiring a nonparametric approach is to answer a question about something other than a parameter. For example, analysts often wish to address whether a sample is truly random or whether the data have a pattern indicating that it is not random (tested with the so-called \"runs test\"). Tests such as Kolmogorov-Smirnov find whether a sample comes from a population that is distributed a certain way. Most of these nonparametric examples are specialized and unlikely to be tested in any detail on the CFA Level I exam.\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_56", "text": "\nFinancial variables are often analyzed for their correlation to other variables and/or market averages. The relative degree of co-movement can serve as a powerful predictor of future behavior of that variable. A sample covariance and correlation coefficient are tools used to indicate relation, while a linear regression is a technique designed both to quantify a positive relationship between random variables, and prove that one variable is dependent on another variable. When you are analyzing a security, if returns are found to be significantly dependent on a market index or some other independent source, then both return and risk can be better explained and understood. \n\nScatter Plots\nA scatter plot is designed to show a relationship between two variables by graphing a series of observations on a two-dimensional graph - one variable on the X-axis, the other on the Y-axis.\n\nFigure 2.15: Scatter Plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSample Covariance\nTo quantify a linear relationship between two variables, we start by finding the covariance of a sample of paired observations. A sample covariance between two random variables X and Y is the average value of the cross-product of all observed deviations from each respective sample mean. A cross-product, for the ith observation in a sample, is found by this calculation: (ith observation of X - sample mean of X) * (ith observation of Y - sample mean of Y). The covariance is the sum of all cross-products, divided by (n - 1). \n\nTo illustrate, take a sample of five paired observations of annual returns for two mutual funds, which we will label X and Y:\n\n\n\n\n\nYear\n\n\nX return\n\n\nY return\n\n\nCross-Product: (Xi - Xmean)*(Yi - Ymean)\n\n\n\n\n1st\n\n\n+15.5\n\n\n+9.6\n\n\n(15.5 - 6.6)*(9.6 - 7.3) = 20.47\n\n\n\n\n2nd\n\n\n+10.2\n\n\n+4.5\n\n\n(10.2 - 6.6)*(4.5 - 7.3) = -10.08\n\n\n\n\n3rd\n\n\n-5.2\n\n\n+0.2\n\n\n(-5.2 - 6.6)*(0.2 - 7.3) = 83.78\n\n\n\n\n4th\n\n\n-6.3\n\n\n-1.1\n\n\n(-6.3 - 6.6)*(-1.1 - 7.3)  = 108.36\n\n\n\n\n5th\n\n\n+12.7\n\n\n+23.5\n\n\n(12.7 - 6.6)*(23.5 - 7.3) = 196.02\n\n\n\n\nSum\n\n\n32.9\n\n\n36.7\n\n\n398.55\n\n\n\n\nAverage\n\n\n6.6\n\n\n7.3\n\n\n398.55/(n - 1) = 99.64 = Cov (X,Y)\n\n\n\n\nAverage X and Y returns were found by dividing the sum by n or 5, while the average of the cross-products is computed by dividing the sum by n - 1, or 4. The use of n - 1 for covariance is done by statisticians to ensure an unbiased estimate. \n\nInterpreting a covariance number is difficult for those who are not statistical experts. The 99.64 we computed for this example has a sign of \"returns squared\" since the numbers were percentage returns, and a return squared is not an intuitive concept. The fact that Cov(X,Y) of 99.64 was greater than 0 does indicate a positive or linear relationship between X and Y. Had the covariance been a negative number, it would imply an inverse relationship, while 0 means no relationship. Thus 99.64 indicates that the returns have positive co-movement (when one moves higher so does the other), but doesn't offer any information on the extent of the co-movement.\n\nSample Correlation Coefficient\nBy calculating a correlation coefficient, we essentially convert a raw covariance number into a standard format that can be more easily interpreted to determine the extent of the relationship between two variables. The formula for calculating a sample correlation coefficient (r) between two \n\nrandom variables X and Y is the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nFormula 2.39\nr = (covariance between X, Y) / (sample standard deviation of X) * (sample std. dev. of Y).\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Correlation Coefficient\nReturn to our example from the previous section, where covariance was found to be 99.64.

Standard deviation is the positive square root of variance: in this example, sample standard deviation of X is (136.06)1/2, or 11.66; sample standard deviation of Y is (99.14)1/2, or 9.96.\n\nTherefore, the correlation coefficient is (99.64)/11.66*9.96 = 0.858. A correlation coefficient is a value between -1 (perfect inverse relationship) and +1 (perfect linear relationship) - the closer it is to 1, the stronger the relationship. This example computed a number of 0.858, which would suggest a strong linear relationship.\n\nHypothesis Testing: Determining Whether a Positive or Inverse Relationship Exists Between Two Random Variables\nA hypothesis-testing procedure can be used to determine whether there is a positive relationship or an inverse relationship between two random variables. This test uses each step of the hypothesis-testing procedure, outlined earlier in this study guide. For this particular test, the null hypothesis, or H0, is that the correlation in the population is equal to 0. The alternative hypothesis, Ha, is that the correlation is different from 0. The t-test is the appropriate test statistic. Given a sample correlation coefficient r, and sample size n, the formula for the test statistic is this:\n\nt = r*(n - 2)1/2/(1 - r2)1/2, with degrees of freedom = n - 2 since we have 2 variables.\n\nTesting whether a correlation coefficient is equal/not equal to 0 is a two-tailed test. In our earlier example with a sample of 5, degrees of freedom = 5 - 2 = 3, and our rejection point from the t-distribution, at a significance level of 0.05, would be 3.182 (p = 0.025 for each tail).\n\nUsing our computed sample r of 0.858, t = r*(n - 2)1/2/(1 - r2)1/2 = (0.858)*(3)1/2/(1 - (0.858)2)1/2 = (1.486)/(0.514) = 2.891. Comparing 2.891 to our rejection point of 3.182, we do not have enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis that the population correlation coefficient is 0. In this case, while it does appear that there is a strong linear relationship between our two variables (and thus we may well be risking a type II error), the results of the hypothesis test show the effects of a small sample size; that is, we had just three degrees of freedom, which required a high rejection level for the test statistic in order to reject the null hypothesis. Had there been one more observation on our sample (i.e. degrees of freedom = 4), then the rejection point would have been 2.776 and we would have rejected the null and accepted that there is likely to be a significant difference from 0 in the population r. In addition, level of significance plays a role in this hypothesis test. In this particular example, we would reject the null hypothesis at a 0.1 level of significance, where the rejection level would be any test statistic higher than 2.353. \n\nOf course, a hypothesis-test process is designed to give information about that example and the pre-required assumptions (done prior to calculating the test statistic). Thus it would stand that the null could not be rejected in this case. Quite frankly, the hypothesis-testing exercise gives us a tool to establish significance to a sample correlation coefficient, taking into account the sample size. Thus, even though 0.858 feels close to 1, it's also not close enough to make conclusions about correlation of the underlying populations - with small sample size probably a factor in the test.\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_57", "text": "\n\nLinear Regression\nA linear regression is constructed by fitting a line through a scatter plot of paired observations between two variables. The sketch below illustrates an example of a linear regression line drawn through a series of (X, Y) observations:\n\nFigure 2.16: Linear Regression\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA linear regression line is usually determined quantitatively by a best-fit procedure such as least squares (i.e. the distance between the regression line and every observation is minimized). In linear regression, one variable is plotted on the X axis and the other on the Y. The X variable is said to be the independent variable, and the Y is said to be the dependent variable. When analyzing two random variables, you must choose which variable is independent and which is dependent. The choice of independent and dependent follows from the hypothesis - for many examples, this distinction should be intuitive. The most popular use of regression analysis is on investment returns, where the market index is independent while the individual security or mutual fund is dependent on the market. In essence, regression analysis formulates a hypothesis that the movement in one variable (Y) depends on the movement in the other (X).\n\nRegression Equation\nThe regression equation describes the relationship between two variables and is given by the general format:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormula 2.40\n\nY = a + bX + \u03b5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere: Y = dependent variable; X = independent variable, \na = intercept of regression line; b = slope of regression line, \n\u03b5 = error term\n\nIn this format, given that Y is dependent on X, the slope b indicates the unit changes in Y for every unit change in X. If b = 0.66, it means that every time X increases (or decreases) by a certain amount, Y increases (or decreases) by 0.66*that amount. The intercept a indicates the value of Y at the point where X = 0. Thus if X indicated market returns, the intercept would show how the dependent variable performs when the market has a flat quarter where returns are 0. In investment parlance, a manager has a positive alpha because a linear regression between the manager's performance and the performance of the market has an intercept number a greater than 0.\n\nLinear Regression - Assumptions\nDrawing conclusions about the dependent variable requires that we make six assumptions, the classic assumptions in relation to the linear regression model:\n\n\nThe relationship between the dependent variable Y and the independent variable X is linear in the slope and intercept parameters a and b. This requirement means that neither regression parameter can be multiplied or divided by another regression parameter (e.g. a/b), and that both parameters are raised to the first power only. In other words, we can't construct a linear model where the equation was Y = a + b2X + \u03b5, as unit changes in X would then have a b2 effect on a, and the relation would be nonlinear.\n\nThe independent variable X is not random.\n\nThe expected value of the error term \"\u03b5\" is 0. Assumptions #2 and #3 allow the linear regression model to produce estimates for slope b and intercept a.\n\nThe variance of the error term is constant for all observations. Assumption #4 is known as the \"homoskedasticity assumption\". When a linear regression is heteroskedastic its error terms vary and the model may not be useful in predicting values of the dependent variable. \n\nThe error term \u03b5 is uncorrelated across observations; in other words, the covariance between the error term of one observation and the error term of the other is assumed to be 0. This assumption is necessary to estimate the variances of the parameters.\n\nThe distribution of the error terms is normal. Assumption #6 allows hypothesis-testing methods to be applied to linear-regression models.\n\nStandard Error of Estimate\nAbbreviated SEE, this measure gives an indication of how well a linear regression model is working. It compares actual values in the dependent variable Y to the predicted values that would have resulted had Y followed exactly from the linear regression. For example, take a case where a company's financial analyst has developed a regression model relating annual GDP growth to company sales growth by the equation Y = 1.4 + 0.8X. \n\nAssume the following experience (on the next page) over a five-year period; predicted data is a function of the model and GDP, and \"actual\" data indicates what happened at the company: \n\n\n\n\n\nYear\n\n\n(Xi) GDP growth \n\n\nPredicted co. growth (Yi)\n\n\nActual co. Growth (Yi)\n\n\nResidual\n(Yi - Yi)\n\n\nSquared residual\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n5.1\n\n\n5.5\n\n\n5.2\n\n\n-0.3\n\n\n0.09\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n2.1\n\n\n3.1\n\n\n2.7\n\n\n-0.4\n\n\n0.16\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n-0.9\n\n\n0.7\n\n\n1.5\n\n\n0.8\n\n\n0.64\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n0.2\n\n\n1.6\n\n\n3.1\n\n\n1.5\n\n\n2.25\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\n6.4\n\n\n6.5\n\n\n6.3\n\n\n-0.2\n\n\n0.04\n\n\n\n\nTo find the standard error of the estimate, we take the sum of all squared residual terms and divide by (n - 2), and then take the square root of the result. In this case, the sum of the squared residuals is 0.09+0.16+0.64+2.25+0.04 = 3.18. With five observations, n - 2 = 3, and SEE = (3.18/3)1/2 = 1.03%. \n\nThe computation for standard error is relatively similar to that of standard deviation for a sample (n - 2 is used instead of n - 1). It gives some indication of the predictive quality of a regression model, with lower SEE numbers indicating that more accurate predictions are possible. However, the standard-error measure doesn't indicate the extent to which the independent variable explains variations in the dependent model.\n\nCoefficient of Determination\nLike the standard error, this statistic gives an indication of how well a linear-regression model serves as an estimator of values for the dependent variable. It works by measuring the fraction of total variation in the dependent variable that can be explained by variation in the independent variable. \n\nIn this context, total variation is made up of two fractions:\n\nTotal variation = explained variation + unexplained variation\ntotal variation  total variation\n\nThe coefficient of determination, or explained variation as a percentage of total variation, is the first of these two terms. It is sometimes expressed as 1 - (unexplained variation / total variation). \n\nFor a simple linear regression with one independent variable, the simple method for computing the coefficient of determination is squaring the correlation coefficient between the dependent and independent variables. Since the correlation coefficient is given by r, the coefficient of determination is popularly known as \"R2, or R-squared\". For example, if the correlation coefficient is 0.76, the R-squared is (0.76)2 = 0.578. R-squared terms are usually expressed as percentages; thus 0.578 would be 57.8%. A second method of computing this number would be to find the total variation in the dependent variable Y as the sum of the squared deviations from the sample mean. Next, calculate the standard error of the estimate following the process outlined in the previous section. The coefficient of determination is then computed by (total variation in Y - unexplained variation in Y) / total variation in Y. This second method is necessary for multiple regressions, where there is more than one independent variable, but for our context we will be provided the r (correlation coefficient) to calculate an R-squared.\n\nWhat R2 tells us is the changes in the dependent variable Y that are explained by changes in the independent variable X. R2 of 57.8 tells us that 57.8% of the changes in Y result from X; it also means that 1 - 57.8% or 42.2% of the changes in Y are unexplained by X and are the result of other factors. So the higher the R-squared, the better the predictive nature of the linear-regression model. \n\nRegression Coefficients\nFor either regression coefficient (intercept a, or slope b), a confidence interval can be determined with the following information:\n\n\nAn estimated parameter value from a sample\n\nStandard error of the estimate (SEE)\n\nSignificance level for the t-distribution\n\nDegrees of freedom (which is sample size - 2)\n\n\nFor a slope coefficient, the formula for confidence interval is given by b \u00b1 tc*SEE, where tc is the critical t value at our chosen significant level.\n\nTo illustrate, take a linear regression with a mutual fund's returns as the dependent variable and the S&P 500 index as the independent variable. For five years of quarterly returns, the slope coefficient b is found to be 1.18, with a standard error of the estimate of 0.147. Student's t-distribution for 18 degrees of freedom (20 quarters - 2) at a 0.05 significance level is 2.101. This data gives us a confidence interval of 1.18 \u00b1 (0.147)*(2.101), or a range of 0.87 to 1.49. Our interpretation is that there is only a 5% chance that the slope of the population is either less than 0.87 or greater than 1.49 - we are 95% confident that this fund is at least 87% as volatile as the S&P 500, but no more than 149% as volatile, based on our five-year sample.\n\nHypothesis testing and Regression Coefficients\nRegression coefficients are frequently tested using the hypothesis-testing procedure. Depending on what the analyst is intending to prove, we can test a slope coefficient to determine whether it explains chances in the dependent variable, and the extent to which it explains changes. Betas (slope coefficients) can be determined to be either above or below 1 (more volatile or less volatile than the market). Alphas (the intercept coefficient) can be tested on a regression between a mutual fund and the relevant market index to determine whether there is evidence of a sufficiently positive alpha (suggesting value added by the fund manager). \n\nThe mechanics of hypothesis testing are similar to the examples we have used previously. A null hypothesis is chosen based on a not-equal-to, greater-than or less-than-case, with the alternative satisfying all values not covered in the null case. Suppose in our previous example where we regressed a mutual fund's returns on the S&P 500 for 20 quarters our hypothesis is that this mutual fund is more volatile than the market. A fund equal in volatility to the market will have slope b of 1.0, so for this hypothesis test, we state the null hypothesis (H0)as the case where slope is less than or greater to 1.0 (i.e. H0: b < 1.0). The alternative hypothesis Ha has b > 1.0. We know that this is a greater-than case (i.e. one-tailed) - if we assume a 0.05 significance level, t is equal to 1.734 at degrees of freedom = n - 2 = 18. \n\nExample: Interpreting a Hypothesis Test\nFrom our sample, we had estimated b of 1.18 and standard error of 0.147. Our test statistic is computed with this formula: t = estimated coefficient - hypothesized coeff. / standard error = (1.18 - 1.0)/0.147 = 0.18/0.147, or t = 1.224. \n\nFor this example, our calculated test statistic is below the rejection level of 1.734, so we are not able to reject the null hypothesis that the fund is more volatile than the market.\n\nInterpretation: the hypothesis that b > 1 for this fund probably needs more observations (degrees of freedom) to be proven with statistical significance. Also, with 1.18 only slightly above 1.0, it is quite possible that this fund is actually not as volatile as the market, and we were correct to not reject the null hypothesis.\n\nExample: Interpreting a regression coefficient\nThe CFA exam is likely to give the summary statistics of a linear regression and ask for interpretation. To illustrate, assume the following statistics for a regression between a small-cap growth fund and the Russell 2000 index:\n\n\n\n\n\nCorrelation coefficient\n\n0.864\n\n\n\nIntercept\n\n-0.417\n\n\n\nSlope\n\n1.317\n\n\n\n\nWhat do each of these numbers tell us?\n\n\nVariation in the fund is about 75%, explained by changes in the Russell 2000 index. This is true because the square of the correlation coefficient, (0.864)2 = 0.746, gives us the coefficient of determination or R-squared.\n\nThe fund will slightly underperform the index when index returns are flat. This results from the value of the intercept being -0.417. When X = 0 in the regression equation, the dependent variable is equal to the intercept.\n\nThe fund will on average be more volatile than the index. This fact follows from the slope of the regression line of 1.317 (i.e. for every 1% change in the index, we expect the fund's return to change by 1.317%).\n\nThe fund will outperform in strong market periods, and underperform in weak markets. This fact follows from the regression. Additional risk is compensated with additional reward, with the reverse being true in down markets. Predicted values of the fund's return, given a return for the market, can be found by solving for Y = -0.417 + 1.317X (X = Russell 2000 return).\n\nAnalysis of Variance (ANOVA)\nAnalysis of variance, or ANOVA, is a procedure in which the total variability of a random variable is subdivided into components so that it can be better understood, or attributed to each of the various sources that cause the number to vary. \n\nApplied to regression parameters, ANOVA techniques are used to determine the usefulness in a regression model, and the degree to which changes in an independent variable X can be used to explain changes in a dependent variable Y. For example, we can conduct a hypothesis-testing procedure to determine whether slope coefficients are equal to zero (i.e. the variables are unrelated), or if there is statistical meaning to the relationship (i.e. the slope b is different from zero). An F-test can be used for this process.\n\nF-Test\nThe formula for F-statistic in a regression with one independent variable is given by the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormula 2.41\nF = mean regression sum of squares / mean squared error \n= (RSS/1) / [SSE/(n - 2)] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe two abbreviations to understand are RSS and SSE:\n\n\nRSS, or the regression sum of squares, is the amount of total variation in the dependent variable Y that is explained in the regression equation. The RSS is calculated by computing each deviation between a predicted Y value and the mean Y value, squaring the deviation and adding up all terms. If an independent variable explains none of the variations in a dependent variable, then the predicted values of Y are equal to the average value, and RSS = 0.\n\nSSE, or the sum of squared error of residuals, is calculated by finding the deviation between a predicted Y and an actual Y, squaring the result and adding up all terms.\n\nTSS, or total variation, is the sum of RSS and SSE. In other words, this ANOVA process breaks variance into two parts: one that is explained by the model and one that is not. Essentially, for a regression equation to have high predictive quality, we need to see a high RSS and a low SSE, which will make the ratio (RSS/1)/[SSE/(n - 2)] high and (based on a comparison with a critical F-value) statistically meaningful. The critical value is taken from the F-distribution and is based on degrees of freedom.\n\nFor example, with 20 observations, degrees of freedom would be n - 2, or 18, resulting in a critical value (from the table) of 2.19. If RSS were 2.5 and SSE were 1.8, then the computed test statistic would be F = (2.5/(1.8/18) = 25, which is above the critical value, which indicates that the regression equation has predictive quality (b is different from 0)\n\nEstimating Economic Statistics with Regression Models\nRegression models are frequently used to estimate economic statistics such as inflation and GDP growth. Assume the following regression is made between estimated annual inflation (X, or independent variable) and the actual number (Y, or dependent variable):\n\nY = 0.154 + 0.917X\n\nUsing this model, the predicted inflation number would be calculated based on the model for the following inflation scenarios:\n\n\n\n\n\nInflation estimate\n\n\nInflation based on model\n\n\n\n\n-1.1%\n\n\n-0.85%\n\n\n\n\n+1.4%\n\n\n+1.43%\n\n\n\n\n+4.7%\n\n\n+4.46%\n\n\n\n\nThe predictions based on this model seem to work best for typical inflation estimates, and suggest that extreme estimates tend to overstate inflation - e.g. an actual inflation of just 4.46 when the estimate was 4.7. The model does seem to suggest that estimates are highly predictive. Though to better evaluate this model, we would need to see the standard error and the number of observations on which it is based. If we know the true value of the regression parameters (slope and intercept), the variance of any predicted Y value would be equal to the square of the standard error.\n\nIn practice, we must estimate the regression parameters; thus our predicted value for Y is an estimate based on an estimated model. How confident can we be in such a process? In order to determine a prediction interval, employ the following steps:\n\n1. Predict the value of the dependent variable Y based on independent observation X.\n\n2. Compute the variance of the prediction error, using the following equation:\n\n\n\n\n\nFormula 2.42 \n\n\n\n\n\nWhere: s2 is the squared standard error of the estimate, n is number of observations, X is the value of the independent variable used to make the prediction, X is the estimated mean value of the independent variable, and sx2 is the variance of X.\n\n3. Choose a significance level \u03b1 for the confidence interval.\n\n4. Construct an interval at (1 - \u03b1) percent confidence, using the structure Y \u00b1 tc*sf. \n\nHere's another case where the material becomes much more technical than necessary and one can get bogged down in preparing, when in reality the formula for variance of a prediction error isn't likely to be covered. Prioritize - don't squander precious study hours memorizing it. If the concept is tested at all, you'll likely be given the answer to Part 2. Simply know how to use the structure in Part 4 to answer a question.\n\nFor example, if the predicted X observation is 2 for the regression Y = 1.5 + 2.5X, we would have a predicted Y of 1.5 + 2.5*(2), or 6.5. Our confidence interval is 6.5 \u00b1 tc*sf. The t-stat is based on a chosen confidence interval and degrees of freedom, while sf is the square root of the equation above (for variance of the prediction error. If these numbers are tc = 2.10 for 95% confidence, and sf = 0.443, the interval is 6.5 \u00b1 (2.1)*(0.443), or 5.57 to 7.43.\n\nLimitations of Regression Analysis\nFocus on three main limitations:\n\n1. Parameter Instability - This is the tendency for relationships between variables to change over time due to changes in the economy or the markets, among other uncertainties. If a mutual fund produced a return history in a market where technology was a leadership sector, the model may not work when foreign and small-cap markets are leaders. \n\n2. Public Dissemination of the Relationship - In an efficient market, this can limit the effectiveness of that relationship in future periods. For example, the discovery that low price-to-book value stocks outperform high price-to-book value means that these stocks can be bid higher, and value-based investment approaches will not retain the same relationship as in the past.\n\n3. Violation of Regression Relationships - Earlier we summarized the six classic assumptions of a linear regression. In the real world these assumptions are often unrealistic - e.g. assuming the independent variable X is not random.\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_58", "text": "\nEconomics involves the choices people make when matching their limitless needs and wants with a scarcity of resources. The word \"economics\" is derived from the Greek words \"oikos\", which means house, and \"nomos\", which means manager. So the term originally referred to management of the household. Today, the term has been broadened to refer to firms and all of society. \n\nAnother way of looking at economics is to consider the field as a set of tools for analyzing people and groups and the choices that they make. Accountants are trained to render an account of financial activity for a company. Lawyers are trained into a certain mode of thinking so as to resolve issues in a legal framework. Similarly, economists are trained to use a set of tools and principles to analyze why individuals, firms, governments and other groups behave as they do.\n\nModels\nEconomists often use models, which are representations of what the economist wishes to analyze. If, for example, an economist wishes to analyze the behavior of a labor union, the economist will not try to include every possible aspect and piece of data about labor unions in his or her model. Important factors will be focused on, such as wages, benefits, alternative jobs, etc. Hopefully the economist's model will include all of the important variables and will give little or no weight to less critical variables. \n\nMost economic analyses include the phrase \"everything else is remaining the same\", so attention can be focused on the variables specified by the model. Of course, this assumption is rarely true in real life. If one were trying to analyze federal deficits and interest rates, for example, there would be plenty of change during the time period analyzed.\n\nThe CFA Level I Exam\nThe economics portion of the CFA Level I exam touches on a wide range of economic theory. The material covered would normally be taught in senior (or graduate level) microeconomic, macroeconomic, money and banking, and international trade courses. You will need to understand all of the material presented here in order to successfully answer all of the questions given. There will be a few questions that require the solution of equations, particularly with regards to foreign exchange.\n\nThis section focuses on preliminary economic concepts you should know for your upcoming exam. Note that your upcoming CFA Level 1 exam will not test directly on these basic concepts, but CFA Institute notes that you should have a basic understanding of these topics to ensure success on the more challenging topics that lie ahead.\n\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_59", "text": "\nWhat is Microeconomics?\r\nMicroeconomics is the branch of economics which looks at choices made by narrowly defined units, such as individual buyers/consumers, and firms that produce goods.\n\r\nTwo of the most important principles used by economists are the Law of Supply and the Law of Demand:\n\nLaw of Supply\r\nThe law of supply says that, all other things remaining equal, as the price of a good increases (decreases), the quantity of that good supplied will increase (decrease).\n\nLaw of Demand\r\nThe law of demand states that, all other things remaining equal, as the price of a good increases (decreases), the quantity of that good demanded will decrease (increase).\n\r\nEconomists often use graphs as a way to demonstrate what is being discussed. The laws of supply and demand can be represented by a simple graph such as the one below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.1: Law of Supply and Demand\n\n\n\n\r\nIn figure 3.1, we can see that at the price of $1, the suppliers are willing to provide one million widgets (Point A), while the quantity demanded will be much higher - eight million (Point B).\n\r\nAt a higher price, such as $5, suppliers will be willing to provide six million widgets (Point D), while the quantity demanded is only one million (Point E).\n\r\nFinally, at the price of $3, the quantity demanded is equal the quantity supplied (Point C). This price is also referred to as the \"market clearing\" or equilibrium price because no suppliers are left with the desire to provide goods at that price and no buyers are left wishing to purchase the goods at that price either.\n\n\n\n\n\nLook Out!\n\r\n\t\t\t\tNote that supply and demand curves depict a quantity supplied or a quantity demanded at a particular price, all other things remaining equal.\n\n\n\n\nChange in Consumer Preference\r\nSuppose there was a significant change in consumer preferences. For example, consumers suddenly have an increased desire for corn. This change in taste may be due to a new health study touting the benefits of corn, alternative grains such as wheat may have gotten more expensive, or corn growers may have conducted an effective advertising campaign. Regardless of the reason, the increase in demand results in a greater quantity demanded at particular price levels. This is an example of a demand shift.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.2: Shift in the Demand Curve\n\n\n\n\r\nIn the graph above D0 represents the original demand curve, while D1 shows the new demand curve. Note that at a particular price level, such as $4, the quantity demanded increases from three million to five million.\n\r\nSuppose something happens where the quantity of a good supplied changes at many particular price levels. For example, technological changes might occur whereby computer memory manufacturers would be able to produce a particular type of memory at a lower cost. So for many price levels, the quantity suppliers are willing to provide will increase. This situation could be diagrammed as below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.3: Shift of the Supply Curve\n\n\n\n\r\nS0 represents the original supply curve, while S1 represents the new supply curve. At the price of $30 per 256MB chip, the quantity supplied will increase from three million to four million units per month.\n\nSupply and Demand Movements\r\nChanges in quantity demanded strictly as a function of price are referred to as movement along a demand curve. A shift of the entire demand curve is referred to as a change in demand; this could be due to any factor(s) that affects demand, other than price.\n\r\nChanges in quantity supplied strictly as a function of price are referred to as movement along a supply curve. A shift of the entire supply curve is referred to as a change in supply; this could be due to any factor(s) that affects supply, other than price.\n\nDemand Curve Shifts\r\nSome of the factors that can cause a demand curve to shift include:\n\n\r\n\t\tChange in income - If consumer incomes increase, we might reasonably expect that demand for some luxury goods will increase.\n\n\nChange in preferences/tastes - If a product becomes more (less) liked, the quantity demanded will increase (decrease).\n\n\nChange in prices of goods that are complimentary - If the price of gasoline goes up substantially, the demand curve for large SUV's should shift down.\n\n\nChanges in prices of goods that are substitutes - If the price of pork increases (decreases), demand for beef would likely increase (decrease).\n\n\nAdvertising - An effective advertising campaign could increase the quantity demanded of a particular good. It could also decrease the demand for a competing good.\n\n\nExpectations - If consumers expect a good to become more expensive or hard to get in the future, it could alter current demand\n\n\nShifts in market demographics - As segments of the population age or their composition changes, their demands also change. Because segments are not equally distributed \u2013 that is, there are not a consistent number of people in every age category \u2013 larger segments have a more noticeable impact on demand. The baby boomers are an excellent example of this.\n\n\nDistribution of income - For example, if the rich get richer, and the poor get poorer, demand for luxury goods could increase.\n\nSupply Curve Shifts\r\nFactors that would cause a shift in the supply curve include:\n\n\nCost - An increase in crude oil costs for a plastic manufacturer would shift the supply curve up and to the left. Changes in technology can dramatically decrease costs.\n\n\nGovernment tax policy - Increases in business taxes will cause the supply curve to shift up and to the left. A government subsidy to producers will cause more supply to be available - the supply curve will shift down and to the right.\n\n\nWeather/climate - Changes in weather and/or climate will especially influence agricultural product supply.\n\n\nPrices of substitute products - If farmers can grow wheat instead of corn, and the price of wheat goes up, then the supply curve for corn will shift up and to the left as more farmers switch from corn to wheat.\n\n\nNumber of producers - As the number of firms/individuals producing a product increases, we would expect more supply to be available.\n\nShort- and Long-Run Market Equilibrium\r\nIn the short run, market equilibrium is achieved when the quantity demanded is equal to quantity supplied and the market clears. The market is said to be cleared because there is no additional quantity supplied, or quantity demanded, at the market clearing price.\n\r\nHowever, that particular market price may not lead to equilibrium in the long run. In the short run, producers do not have time to fully adjust to current market conditions. Some current producers may not be making a profit or covering all their costs at the current market price. Producers in that situation will consider leaving the industry, or at least will not allocate further capital to that industry. If producers are making profits, then we would expect more resources to be allocated to the industry such as the building of additional factories. In the long run, all factors of production can be varied.\n\r\nLong-run equilibrium is something we expect the market to move towards over time. The process could take years. It actually may never be achieved because demand and supply curves are constantly shifting. \n\r\nSuppose there is an increase in demand, as shown by the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.4: Effects of a Shift in Demand\n\n\n\n\r\nD0 is the original demand curve, and D1 is the new demand curve. The market equilibrium price will increase from P0 to P1, at least in the short-run. The quantity will also increase from Q0 to Q1.\n\r\nOver time, in a market economy, two forces will come into play:\n\n\r\n\t\tBuyers will have an incentive to search for substitutes, thereby decreasing their purchase of the original good; this effect will tend to lower the quantity demanded and the market price\n\n\r\n\t\tSuppliers will have an incentive to supply more of the good, and more resources will be allocated towards production of this good; this effect will tend to increase the quantity and lower the market price\n\nShortages and Surpluses and their Effect on Equilibrium Prices\nA \"shortage\" exists when the quantity demanded at the current price is greater than the quantity supplied. In the case of shortage, we would expect the market price to go up. In this case, less motivated buyers do not purchase the good and producers have a strong incentive to supply more at the higher market price. This process will continue until the quantity demanded is equal to the quantity supplied.  A \"surplus\" exists when the quantity supplied is greater than the quantity demanded. In this case, we would expect the market price to go down. The lower market price entices more consumers into buying, but lower profits create an incentive for producers to reduce the quantity supplied. \n\nInvisible Hand Principle\nMarket prices deliver information to producers on how to allocate capital and other resources. Prices tell producers about consumer needs and wants by showing them how much consumers are willing to pay for a particular good or service. Prices also inform consumers by sending signals about how much of a given product is available.\n\nThese market prices act as an \"invisible hand\" that pushes self-interested individuals toward the correct allocation of resources, benefitting both the individuals and society as a whole. No one person is consciously making these decisions.\n\r\nThe following tutorial, entitled Economics Basics, will prime you for the topics discussed in this chapter.\n        \n        \n            \n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_60", "text": "\n        Now that you have completed the basics, let us move onto the various learning outcomes on Microeconomics you should look to know for your upcoming exam.\n\nPrice Elasticity\r\nIn general, the elasticity of a particular variable is the percentage change in quantity demanded or supplied, divided by the percentage change in the variable of concern. This ratio is often called the elasticity coefficient.\n\nPrice elasticity is defined as the percentage change in quantity demanded divided by the percentage change in price.\n\r\nThe price elasticity of demand can be expressed as:\n\n\n\n\n\nFormula 3.1\n \n\n\n\n\nExample: Price Elasticity\r\nWhere Ep is the price elasticity coefficient, %\u0394Q represents the percentage in quantity, and %\u0394P represents the percentage in price. If the price of gasoline goes up by 50%, and the quantity demanded decreases by 20%, the price elasticity of gasoline would be:\n\r\nEp  = %\u0394 Quantity = -20% = -0.4\r\n%\u0394 Price +50%\n\r\nTypically, the negative sign is ignored and we would say that the price elasticity of gasoline is 0.4.\n\r\nTo calculate elasticity we must first have data for quantities purchased at different prices. Suppose that the price of a good goes from P0 to P1, and that we have data for the change in quantity demanded, which goes from Q0 to Q1. The calculation is typically made by dividing the actual change by the average(or midpoint) of the beginning and ending values. Suppose that the quantity demanded of a good goes from 10 to 14. The percentage change in quantity demanded could be expressed as:\n\n(Q0 - Q1) =  4  = 0.333\r\n0.5(Q0 + Q1) 0.5(24)\n\r\nThat number would be multiplied by 100 to get the percentage change, which in this case would be 33.3%.\n\r\nSimilarly, the percentage change in price can be expressed as:\n\n(P0 - P1) x 100\r\n0.5(P0 + P1)\n\n\n\n\n\nLook Out!\r\n\t\t\t\tSometimes the denominator used for these percentage change calculations is simply the original value (P0 and Q0). Because the CFA text uses the midpoint method, unless the exam has instructions to the contrary, it would be safer to use the midpoint method.\n\n\n\n\r\nThe full elasticity calculation can be simplified by canceling out the 0.5 (one-half) and 100. The more simplified expression can be stated as:\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nExample:\r\nSuppose, to continue the example given above, that the change in quantity demanded for the good (10 to 14) was in response to a price decrease from $8 to $7. In that case, the elasticity would be expressed as:\n\n(10 - 14) / (10 + 14) =  -4 / 24 = -1/6  = -15 = -2.5\r\n(8 - 7) / (8 + 7) 1 / 15 1/15 6\n\r\nAlternatively, the elasticity could have been calculated as: -4 divided by half of 24, which is equal to -0.333, over 1 divided by half of 15, which equals 0.1333.\n\r\nSo the elasticity would be -0.333 over 0.133 = - 2.5, the same answer as above.\n\r\nThe following definitions apply to calculations of price elasticity:\n\r\n1) If Ep > 1, Demand is elastic. The percentage change in price will produce a greater percentage in quantity demanded. If the price goes up, then total revenues will go down. If the price goes down, then total revenues willincrease.\n\r\n2) If Ep < 1, Demand is inelastic. The percentage change in price will produce a lower percentage in quantity demanded. If the price goes up, then total revenues will go up. If the price goes down, then total revenues will decrease. Put simply, these changes will be less drastic than if demand is elastic.\n\r\n3) If Ep = 1, Demand has unitary elasticity. A percentage in price will produce the exact same percentage change in quantity. Therefore, changes in price will no have effect on total revenues.\r\nIf demand is elastic for a product, then a small change in price will cause a large change in quantity demanded. If the demand for a product is inelastic, even a large change in price might cause little change in quantity demanded.\n        \n        \n            \n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_61", "text": "\nDeterminants of price elasticity include:\n\n\nAvailability of substitutes - if substitutes are plentiful, then demand should be elastic. \n\nRelative percentage of expenditure - if an item takes up a considerable proportion of a consumer's income, then demand should be elastic; if it takes up a very small amount, then demand should be expected to be inelastic. \n\nAmount of time - consumers can make more adjustments to prices changes over time and, therefore, demand tends to be more elastic as time passes.\n\nNecessities or luxuries - demand for necessities will tend to be inelastic, while demand for luxuries will tend to be elastic.\n\nCross Elasticity of Demand\nCross elasticity of demand relates the percentage change in quantity demanded of a good to the percentage change in price of a substitute or complementary good. Examples of complementary goods would include peanut butter and jelly, and large SUVs and gasoline. The cross elasticity of demand will be positive for a substitute, and negative for a complement; i.e. demand for a substitute (complement) will go up (down), if the price of the substitute (complement) goes up.\n\nThe following formula can be used to calculate cross-elasticity of demand: \n\n\n\n\n\nFormula 3.2\n\n\nWhere: CEp is the cross-price elasticity coefficient,\r\n\t\t\t\t%\u0394Q represents the percentage change in quantity demanded, and\r\n\t\t\t\t%\u0394P represents the percentage change in price of the substitute or complement.\n\n\n\n\nIncome Elasticity\nIncome Elasticity is defined as the percentage change in quantity demanded divided by the percentage change in income. The calculations are similar to those for price elasticity, except that the denominator would include a change in income instead of a change in price.\n\nUsually the amount of goods purchased will be positively correlated with income; if consumers' incomes go up (down), more (less) goods will be purchased. Any good with a positive income of elasticity of demand is said to be a normal good. Luxury goods have high income elasticity (greater than one). The proportionate amount of spending for those goods will go up as incomes increase.\n\nThe amount spent on some goods decrease as incomes goes up. Such goods are referred to as inferior goods. Examples of inferior goods include margarine (inferior to butter) and bus travel (inferior to owning a vehicle).\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_62", "text": "\nSupply elasticity is defined as the percentage change in quantity supplied divided by the percentage change in price. It is calculated as per the following formula:\n\n\n\n\nFormula 3.3\n \n\n\n\n\nThe calculation of elasticity of supply is comparable to the calculation of elasticity of demand, except that the quantities used refer to quantities supplied instead of quantities demanded.\n\nFactors that influence the elasticity of supply include the ability to switch to production of other goods, the ability to go out of business, the ability to use other resource inputs and the amount of time available to respond to a price change.\n\nOver a short time period, firms may be able to increase output only slightly in response to an increase in prices. Over a longer period of time, the level of production can be adjusted greatly as production processes can be altered, additional workers can be hired, more plants can be built, etc. Therefore, elasticity of supply is expected to be greater over longer periods of time.\n\nWe would expect the supply elasticity of wheat to be very high as farmers can easily switch land that is used for wheat over to other crops such as corn and soybeans. On the other hand, an oil refinery cannot easily switch its production capacity over to another product, so low oil-refining margins do not reduce the quantity supplied by very much. Due to high capital costs, higher refining margins do not necessarily induce much greater supply. So the supply elasticity for oil refining is fairly low.\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_63", "text": "\nWithin this section we will focus on determining the difference between marginal benefit and marginal cost, as well as how to calculate the efficient quantity. \n\nConsumer Choice\nEconomic analysis generally assigns the following properties to consumers:\n\n\nConsumers make rational decisions. If two products are of equal benefit to a consumer, then he or she will choose the cheaper product. If two products are the same price, the consumer will choose the one that provides the higher benefit. \n\n\n\nLimited income enforces choice. Consumers have to make choices as to what goods will be purchased or not purchased. Purchasing one item means that less funds are available to purchase other items. \n\n\n\nSubstitution of goods. Consumers can achieve satisfaction, which is generally referred to as utility, with many choices. The satisfaction and cost of a cheeseburger can be evaluated in comparison to other goods - such as hot dogs. \n\n\n\nThe Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility. This law refers to marginal utility, which describes the increase in satisfaction from consuming one additional unit of the good. The Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility states that as each additional unit of a good is consumed, the amount of marginal (incremental) utility will decrease.\n\nEconomists believe that consumers make decisions at the margin; i.e. should one more unit of the good be obtained or not? The consumer will compare the additional (marginal) utility to be achieved by consuming one more unit of the good, to the additional (marginal) utility that must be given up (buying power) in order to obtain the good. At any particular price, the consumer will continue to buy units of the good as long as the marginal benefit, as expressed by maximum willingness to pay, exceeds the price. The marginal benefit indicates, in dollar terms, what the consumer is willing to pay to acquire one more unit of the good; it can also be related to the height of an individual's demand curve. Another implication of the Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility is that the height of the demand curve will fall as more units of the good are consumed.\n\nAnother implication of marginal utility theory is that for consumers to maximize utility, the following relationship holds:\n\nMUa =  MUb =  MUc = and so on...\nPa Pb Pc\n\nMU refers to marginal utility of the good, P represents the price of the good, and the subscripts indicate a particular good. The last unit of each good purchased will provide the same marginal utility per dollar spent on that good.\n\nThe term marginal cost refers to the opportunity cost associated with producing one more additional unit of a good. Opportunity cost is a critical concept to economics - it refers to the value of the highest value alternative opportunity. For example, in examining the marginal cost of producing one more bushel of wheat, that number could be expressed as the dollar value of corn or other goods that could be produced in lieu of more wheat. \n\nMarginal benefit refers to what people are willing to give up in order to obtain one more unit of a good, while marginal cost refers to the value of what is given up in order to produce that additional unit. Additional units of a good should be produced as long as marginal benefit exceeds marginal cost. It would be inefficient to produce goods when the marginal benefit is less than the marginal cost. Therefore an efficient level of product is achieved when marginal benefit is equal to marginal cost.\n\nConsumer Surplus and Marginal Benefit\r\nConsumer surplus represents the difference between what a consumer is willing to pay and the actual price paid. If a consumer is willing to pay $5.00 for a gallon of gasoline, and the actual price is $3.00, then there is a consumer surplus of $2.00 with the purchase of that gallon of gasoline. The value to the consumer, or marginal benefit, is $5.00. Value is calculated by getting the maximum price that consumers are willing to pay.\n\nWe expect consumers to continue purchasing units of a good as long as the marginal benefit exceeds the price paid; i.e., as long as there is a consumer surplus to be achieved. \n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_64", "text": "\n\nMarginal (or Opportunity) Cost and the Minimum Supply Price\r\nThe supply curve (see figure 3.3) represents the quantities of a particular good that producers are willing to supply at various price points. For any particular quantity, the height of the supply curve represents the minimum price that suppliers of a good must get in order to supply the additional unit. That minimum supply price must cover the increase in total costs, or marginal cost, of producing the additional unit. The opportunity cost represents the value of other goods that may have been produced with the resources used. Producers must receive a price at least equal to their opportunity cost.\n\r\nProducer surplus is defined as the difference between what a producer actually receives (which will be the market price) for a product and the producer's minimum supply price (marginal cost) for that product. If a producer is willing to provide a unit of a good for $3.00, and actually gets $4.00, then the producer would have $1.00 of producer surplus.\n\nConsumer Surplus, Producer surplus, and Equilibrium.\r\nWe expect consumers to keep consuming additional units of a good until the marginal benefit no longer exceeds the price, or there is no longer an increase in consumer surplus. Producers will continue to provide additional units of a good up to the point where the market price no longer exceeds their minimum supply price.\n\r\nThe marginal benefit for all people in a society can be described as the marginal social benefit. Similarly the marginal costs for all producers in a society of a good can be described as the marginal social cost. At market equilibrium, the marginal social benefit of consuming an additional unit of a good is just equal to the marginal social cost of producing the additional unit.\n\r\nIn the figure 3.5 below, the triangle defined by the points P2PmQm represents consumer surplus, while the triangle defined by points P1PmQm represents producer surplus.\n\nFigure 3.5: Consumer and Producer Surplus\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow Resources Move Toward Their Most Efficient Allocation\r\nIn economics, a market is efficient if the maximum amount of goods and services are being produced with a given level of resources, and if no additional output is possible without increasing the amount of inputs. Efficient markets ensure optimal resource utilization by allowing for price to motivate independent actors in the economy. If buyers and sellers are free to choose how to allocate resources, prices will direct resources towards those who value them most and can utilize them most effectively.\n\r\nSuppose consumer preferences change so that good A is now more desired than good B. We would expect the price of good A to shift higher and the price of good B to shift lower. This in turn will induce the production of additional units of good A and the devotion of more input resources to good A, while similarly decreasing production of B and its associated input resources.\n\r\nIn the real world today we have seen higher oil prices stimulate more drilling for oil and more investment in oil substitutes. The wage rates of mainframe programmers in the United States has decreased over the last several years in comparison to the year 2000, as there less of a need for their services. The lower wage rates have induced more mainframe programmers to retrain themselves with other computer skills, or to leave the field.\n\r\nObstacles to achieving efficiency include:\n\r\n\u00b7 Price Ceilings/Floors - Sometimes governments impose price ceilings, which define a maximum price, or price floors, which define a minimum price. Effective price ceilings or floors prevent normal market equilibrium.\n\r\n\u00b7 Public Goods are goods available to everyone, even if they don't pay. Examples include police protection and public parks. One reason competitive markets don't produce the optimum amount of a public good is due to the \"free-rider\" problem: those who don't pay get a \"free ride\" with regards to getting the benefit.\n\r\n\u00b7 Externalities reflect costs and benefits not borne by the person or firm making the economic decision, which are imposed on or granted to others. Runoff from large cattle feedlots can damage nearby farms, and this potential cost may not be considered by feedlots when they look at their supply curve. A landowner who chooses not to develop her land may benefit several other homes for purposes of flood control. The benefit to others may not be taken into account when deciding to develop the land.\n\r\n\u00b7 Taxes lead to lower quantities produced, higher prices for buyers and lower effective prices for sellers.\n\r\n\u00b7 Subsidies increase the quantity produced, lower prices for buyers and increase seller prices.\n\r\n\u00b7 Quotas limit the quantity that can be produced.\n\r\n\u00b7 High transaction costs reduce the price that customers are willing to pay and increase supplier costs, leading to an equilibrium quantity that is lower than either party would desire absent the higher costs.\n\r\n\u00b7 Asynchronous information creates a perceived cost for buyers and sellers if they cannot adequately evaluate a proposed transaction. Drug companies can charge premium prices for pharmaceuticals due in part to the established evidence that the drug works. Auto makers entering new markets often have to offer lower prices and/or better warranties because customers do not have sufficient information about the new brands.\n\r\n\u00b7 Discrimination deprives market participants of the ability to conduct business at prices that otherwise be acceptable to them. Businesses that discriminate against certain types of job-seekers may have to pay more for labor, while customers that discriminate against a business may have to pay more for goods.\n\r\n\u00b7 A monopoly means that only one firm can provide a certain good or service. A monopolist will charge a higher price and produce a lower quantity in comparison to a competitive market.\n\r\nWith the exception of the above-mentioned obstacles, a competitive market will use resources efficiently. Goods are produced up to the point where the marginal benefit is equal to the marginal cost, and the sum of consumer and producer surplus is maximized.\n\r\nAlthough price is the dominant means of allocating resources in a market economy, it is not the only way for markets to allocate resources. A command economy relies upon a central planning authority to allocate resources. Markets can also allocate resources by majority rule (citizens vote on the desired allocation of resources), lottery, or force and theft.\n\nThe Fairness Principle, Utilitarianism, and the Symmetry Principle\r\nEconomists often like to examine the \"fairness\" of a situation or economic system. Ideas about fairness can be lumped into one of two categories:\n\r\n\u00b7 \"Results\" must be fair.\r\n\u00b7 \"Rules\" must be fair.\n\nUtilitarianism, which is a moral philosophy developed in 18th and 19th century Great Britain, posits that an action is correct if it increases overall happiness for the performer of the act and those affected by the act. Utilitarians argued that income should be transferred from the rich to the poor until complete equality was achieved.\n\r\nOne problem with utilitarianism is the tradeoff between fairness and inefficiency. An effort to transfer wealth by heavily taxing rich people will decrease incentives for people to save money or work hard. This can lead to inefficient uses of capital and labor. Another source of inefficiency is the administrative cost of transferring money from the rich to the poor.\n\r\nThe symmetry principle is based on the intuitive principle that people in similar situations should be treated the same. From an economic perspective, we would like to achieve equality of opportunity. The symmetry principle adheres to the viewpoint that \"rules\" must be fair.\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_65", "text": "\n\nPrice Ceilings\nIf the price ceiling is above the market price, then there is no direct effect. If the price ceiling is set below the market price, then a \"shortage\" is created; the quantity demanded will exceed the quantity supplied. The shortage may be resolved in many ways. One way is \"queuing\"; people have to wait in line for the product, and only those willing to wait in line for the product will actually get it. Sellers might provide the product only to family and friends, or those willing to pay extra \"under the table\". Another effect may be that sellers will lower the quality of the good sold. \"Black markets\" tend to be created by price ceilings.\n\nFigure 3.6: Effect of Price Ceilings\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.6 illustrates the shortage that occurs when a price ceiling is imposed on suppliers. Consumers demand QD while Suppliers are only willing to supply QS. If the price ceiling is set above the equilibrium, consumers would demand a smaller quantity than suppliers are producing.\n\nEconomic Efficiency: Black Vs. Legal Markets\nLegal systems provide various benefits to economic systems.\n\nEconomic efficiency may be said to occur when an action creates more benefits than costs. Legal systems help economic systems become more efficient by reducing risks to economics participants. Risk represents a cost that must be compensated for by higher charges.\n\nOne risk reduced by government regulation is theft. Government protects the property rights of owners so that they can benefit from the assets they own and use them in an efficient, economic manner. Participants in a \"black market system\" face a high risk of theft in their transactions as well as exposure to other forms of violence.\n\nGovernments often also provide a regulatory framework for the safety of products. In a market operating within a legal system, purchasers of drugs have a reasonable expectation about the quality of the drugs and the expected benefits of the drugs. Participants in a black market for drugs will have incomplete information about the quality of drugs purchased and, therefore, appropriate decisions are more difficult to make.\n\nPrice Floors\nWhen a \"price floor\" is set, a certain minimum amount must be paid for a good or service. If the price floor is below a market price, no direct effect occurs. If the market price is lower than the price floor, then a surplus will be generated. Minimum wage laws are good examples of price floors. In many states, the U.S. minimum wage law has no effect, as market wage rates for low-skilled workers are above the U.S. minimum wage rate. In states where the minimum wage is above the market wage rate, the law will increase unemployment for low-skilled workers. Although some low-skilled workers will get higher pay, others will lose their jobs.\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_66", "text": "\n        Taxes reduce both demand and supply, and drive market equilibrium to a price that is higher than without the tax and a quantity that is lower than without the tax.\n\nActual and Statutory Incidence of Tax\r\nTax authorities usually require either the buyer or the seller to be legally responsible for payment of the tax. Tax incidence is the way in which the burden of a tax is shared among the market participants (\"who bears the cost?\"). Taxes will typically constitute a greater burden for whichever party has a more inelastic curve \u2013 e.g., if supply is inelastic and demand is elastic, the burden will be greater on the producers.\n\r\nSuppose that a state government imposes a tax upon milk producers of $1 per gallon.\n\nFigure 3.7: Incidence of Tax\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nFigure 3.7 shows the original price for milk was $2 per gallon. After imposition of the tax, the supply curves shift up and to the left. Consumers pay $2.60 per gallon. Sellers receive $1.60 per gallon after paying the tax. So sixty cents of the tax is actually paid by consumers, while forty cents is paid by the milk producers.\n\r\nThe triangle ABC above represents the deadweight loss due to taxation, which occurs because now there are fewer mutually beneficial exchanges between buyers and sellers. Deadweight loss stems from foregone economic activity and is a loss that does not lead to an offsetting gain for other market participants; it is a permanent decrease to consumer and/or producer surplus.\n\nElasticity of Supply and Demand and the Incidence of Tax\r\nIf buyers have many alternatives to a good with a new tax, they will tend to respond to a rise in price by buying other things and will, therefore, not accept a much higher price. If sellers easily can switch to producing other goods, or if they will respond to even a small reduction in payments by going out of business, then they will not accept a much lower price. The incidence of the tax will tend to fall on the side of the market that has the least attractive alternatives and, therefore, has a lower elasticity.\n\r\nCigarettes are one example where buyers have relatively few options; we would therefore expect the primary burden of cigarette taxes to fall upon the buyers.\n\r\nA subsidy shifts either the demand or supply curve to the right, depending upon whether the buyer or seller receives the subsidy. If it is the buyer receiving the subsidy, the demand curve shifts right, leading to an increase in the quantity demanded and the equilibrium price. If the seller receives the subsidy, the supply curve shifts right and the quantity demanded will increase, while the equilibrium price decreases.\n\r\nA quota limits the amounts of a good that can be produced. If the quota is greater than what would be produced under normal market conditions, then it will have no effect. If the amount is less, than the market equilibrium that is achieved will be at a higher price than what would occur without the quota, as consumers will be willing to pay more.\n\r\nMaking a good or service illegally impacts demand, supply and market equilibrium by imposing a cost (prosecution and punishment) on the buyer or seller (or both) of the good/service. Quantities of illegal goods will always be less than if they were legal, but the impact on price is determined by whether the buyer or seller (or both) is punished. If the only the buyer is penalized, the equilibrium price will be lower; the risk of punishment is regarded by buyers as a cost, and reduces the price they will pay to the seller. If the seller is penalized, the equilibrium price will be higher as the cost of punishment is factored into the seller's cost. Prices will remain relatively unchanged if the risk and cost of punishment is shared equally.\n\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_67", "text": "\n\nExplicit Costs\nExplicit costs reflect monetary payments made to resource owners. Examples include wages, lease payments and interest payments.\n\nImplicit Costs\nImplicit costs are those associated with resources used by the firm, but with no direct monetary payment. For example, there may not be an explicit monetary payment associated with the work efforts of a sole proprietor; however, there is an implicit cost associated with those work efforts as the sole proprietor could earn wages elsewhere. For a firm's capital, there is an implicit cost involved as the firm could be getting interest or earning a rate of return elsewhere. The implicit cost associated with the highest-valued alternative opportunity is referred to as the opportunity cost.\n\nOn the reverse side, particularly for an individual, there may be forms of implicit (\"psychic\") revenues; for example, a person may particularly enjoy \"being his own boss\".\n\nEconomic Profit\nEconomic profit is equal to total revenues less both implicit and explicit costs. For a firm to stay in business, both implicit and explicit costs must be covered. If firms are receiving a negative economic profit in a market, they will leave that market. A normal profitrate exactly covers wage costs and the competitive rate of return on capital.\n\nAccounting Profits\nAccounting profits are generally higher than economic profits, as they omit certain costs, such as the value of owner-provided labor and the firm's equity capital.\n\nWhen calculating \"economic profit\", explicit and opportunity costs are taken into account.\n\nExample:\nSuppose someone owns and runs a candy store that grosses $20,000 per month and has operating expenses of $14,000 per month. The store owner particularly enjoys socializing with the customers; this aspect of the business provides a comfort to the owner which is worth $2,000 a month to her. The owner could receive $3,000 a month in interest with the capital that is tied up in the store's inventory. She could earn $5,000 a month at a different job.\n\nAn income statement would show an accounting profit of $6,000 a month:\n\nExplicit Revenues $20,000\n\nExplicit Costs $14,000\n----------\nAccounting Profit $ 6,000\n\nAnswer:\nThe economic profit, which should determine the economic decision, would be calculated as follows:\n\nExplicit Revenues $20,000\n\nImplicit Revenue\n(value of socialization) $ 2,000\n- - - - - -\nEconomic Revenues $22,000\nExplicit Costs $14,000\n\nImplicit Costs:\nValue of owner's labor $5,000\nRequired rate of return on\ninventory investment   $3,000\n- - - - - -\nEconomic Profit  ($2,000)\n\nFrom an economic viewpoint, keeping the candy store open does not make sense. The implicit value of enjoying being with the customers is not of sufficient value in comparison to the fact that the store owner could make more money by working elsewhere and employing the capital elsewhere.\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_68", "text": "\n\nFirm Constraints\r\nConstraints on a firm include:\r\n\n\nInformation - firms will not have complete information regarding strategies of competitors, ethics of their workers, customer buying plans, forthcoming technologies and many other factors that affect firm profitability. Acquiring relevant information can be costly, so benefits and costs of acquiring information must be weighed.\n\nMarket - prices firms charge will be impacted by the offerings of other firms. Firms are in competition with other firms for resources such as employees and raw materials. Market constraints limit what firms can charge and enforce pricing on the input side.\n\nTechnology - economists view technology as the methods and processes that firms use to produce goods and/or services. There is a \"technology\" associated with any business, and the set of available technologies will limit what a firm can do and impact its profit.\n\nTechnological vs. Economic Efficiency\r\nTechnological efficiency relates quantities of inputs to the quantity of output, while economic efficiency relates the dollar value of inputs to the dollar value of output. A firm would be operating with technological efficiency when it produces a certain level of output with the least amount of input. Economic efficiency would be achieved when a certain level of output is produced with the lowest cost of inputs.\n\r\nSuppose there are two available methods to produce widgets, one that is highly automated with industrial robots, and a mostly manual one that requires significantly more workers. The automated method costs $50,000 per month to produce 1,000 widgets over a monthly period, using three robots and one worker. The manual method costs $40,000 per month to produce 1,000 widgets over the same time period, with 10 workers that have a minimal amount of tools. We can't say that either method is technologically inefficient - the automated method requires fewer workers, while the manual method requires less capital for the same quantity of output. However, we can say that the manual method is economically efficient, since it produces 1,000 widgets at the lower cost.\n\nWays to Organize Production\r\nThere are two broadly defined methods of organizing production. A command system utilizes a hierarchical organization whereby commands flow down from the top of the organization. Armies typically are organized by this method. An incentive system tries to provide market-like incentives to each layer of the organization. Sales organizations predominantly use incentive systems. Incentives also can be provided to personnel, such as assembly line workers, by relating pay to certain production targets.\n\nThe Principal-Agent Problem\r\nThe principal-agent problem is an example of incomplete and asymmetric information. Principal-agent problems occur when the principal (buyer) has less information than the agent (supplier). For example, a patient at a hospital has much less information about the medical treatments being conducted than the doctors. The patient would prefer to have the illness resolved at the lowest possible cost to him. The doctors may be facing pressures or may be influenced by incentives that are not in the best interests of the patient. It is difficult for the patient to judge the quality of his or her own treatment.\n\nOwners (shareholders) of firms face similar problems. The owner (principal) compensates an agent (an employee) to perform acts that are useful to the principal, costly (or otherwise undesirable) to the agent, and where performance is costly or difficult to observe. Because of the difficulty/cost of observing the work, the principal finds it difficult to assess the agent's competence and achievements and adjusting compensation accordingly. Likewise, there is an inherent conflict of interest at work \u2013 the principal seeks to gain maximum output for minimum compensation, while the agent seeks to maximize compensation and minimize output. \n\nA firm can reduce principal-agent problems by giving the agent an ownership stake in the enterprise, incentive compensation and/or a long-term employment contract. These serve to give the agent a vested interest in the overall health of the enterprise and align the interests of the principal and the agent. \n\nTypes of Business Firms:\n\nProprietorships\r\nProprietorships are businesses owned by a single individual (or sometimes a family). Risks and rewards for the business are the responsibility of that one individual. Note that the sole proprietor is legally responsible for the debts of the business.\n\nPartnerships\r\nPartnerships are businesses that have two or more people acting as co-owners of the business. Agreements are made beforehand as to how to share the risks and rewards. As with proprietorships, owners are personally responsible for all debts associated with the business. Law firms and accounting firms are organized often as partnerships.\n\nCorporations\r\nCorporations are businesses that have been granted a charter so that they are recognized as separate legal entities. Individuals in a corporation are not subject to the liabilities of the firm; the most that they can lose is the amount they invested. Taxes are paid, assets are acquired and contracts are entered into n the name of the corporation. Corporations generally have easier access to capital than proprietorships or partnerships.\n\r\nMajor factors promoting cost efficiency and customer service within the corporate world include:\n\n1. The threat of takeover - Inefficient corporate management can attract the interest of outsiders, who will try to take over of the corporation with the intent of running the corporation more efficiently, so as to increase shareholder value. The takeover company most likely would remove the current management. The threat of such a takeover gives management an incentive to serve the interests of corporate shareholders.\n\n2.Competition for capital and customers - Poor management will tend to drive the price of a company's stock down, which will tend to make raising more capital difficult. An efficient and/or innovative management will tend to cause the price of a company's stock to go up, which will make raising additional capital easier. The corporation's products must be competitive, in terms of both price and quality, in order to attract customers. The production of inferior goods will tend to drive customers away, which will decrease corporate revenues. Therefore, competitive forces tend to limit the ability of management to serve their own needs in lieu of stockholder and customer needs.\n\n3.Management compensation - Compensation can be set up so that management incentives are in line with those of the corporation. For example, a significant amount of executive compensation can be in the form of stock options, which are of value only when a certain stock price is met.\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_69", "text": "\n\nPrice Taker Markets\nA purely competitive (price taker) market exists when the following conditions occur:\n\n\u00b7 Low entry and exit barriers - there are no restraints on firms entering or exiting the market\n\u00b7Homogeneity of products - buyers can purchase the good from any seller and receive the same good\n\u00b7Perfect knowledge about product quality, price and cost\n\u00b7No single buyer or seller is large enough to influence the market price\n\nSellers must take the existing market price and they will adjust the quantity of their products so as to maximize profit at the market price. Because sellers must take the current market price, a purely competitive market also is called a \"price takers\" market.\n\nPrice-Searcher Markets\nPrice-searcher markets are characterized by:\n\n1.Barriers to Entry\n2.Firms in the Markets that have Downward-Sloping Demand Curves \n\nWhile perfectly competitive markets have a homogeneity of goods, price-searcher markets have a differentiation of goods. The differentiation could be in the form of location, taste, packaging, design, quality and many other factors. Some textbooks use the phrase \"monopolistic competition\" to describe markets where each firm has something unique about its product while facing significant competition. A good example would be a gas station. Although there are many competing gas stations, an individual gas station is the only one at its particular location and, therefore, to some degree it has a monopoly or is a sole seller. The CFA text prefers the term \"competitive price searcher\".\n\nFirms in a price-searcher market with low barriers to entry have some flexibility to raise prices, as they will not lose all their customers if they do so. For example, if Valvoline raises the price of its motor oil, some people will be willing to pay the price for the motor oil they prefer. However, rival firms such as Pennzoil or Castrol also provide similar motor oils. As Valvoline raises its prices, many customers will switch to rival suppliers. The demand curve faced by firms in competitive price search markets, such as motor oil, will be highly elastic.\n\nFirms in price-searcher markets with low barriers to entry face competition from existing suppliers and potential new entrants. If economic profits are being made in the market, then more firms will be expected to enter the market. Price searchers can set their prices, but the actual quantities sold will depend upon market forces.\n\nMonopoly\nMonopoly refers to a \"single seller\". The single seller will have a market with no well-defined substitute. The monopolist does not need to worry about the reactions of other firms. Utility companies are often monopolists in particular markets.\n\nConcentration\r\nConcentration within an industry refers to the degree to which a small number of firms provide a major portion of the industry's total production. If concentration is low, then the industry is considered to be competitive. If the concentration is high, then the industry will be viewed as oligopolistic or monopolistic. Government agencies such as the U.S. Department of Justice examine concentration within an industry when deciding to approve potential mergers between industry firms.\n\nThe most common measure of concentration is the four-firm concentration ratio, which is defined as the percentage of the industry's output sold by the four largest firms. An industry with a four-firm concentration ratio of forty percent is generally considered to be competitive.\n\r\nThe Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) calculates concentration ratios by squaring the market share of the fifty largest firms in an industry. The formula can be expressed as follows:\n\nFormula 3.4 \n\nHHI = s12 + s22 + s32 + ... + sn2 \n\n(where sn is the market share of the ith firm).\n\nA monopoly would have the largest possible value - 1002 = 10000. The HHI for a highly fragmented industry would be close to zero. The Justice Department generally considers an industry with an HHI above 1800 to be highly concentrated.\n\nLimitations of Concentration Measures\nConcentration ratios have some of the following limitations: \n\n\u00b7 Foreign production \u2013 concentration ratios often fail to fully incorporate the revenue from foreign companies, thus overestimating the concentration of a domestic industry and underestimating the impact of foreign goods on competition. \n\n\u00b7 Ease of entry \u2013 an industry may have relatively few participants, but low barriers to entry. In such cases, a concentration ratio will overstate the power of current suppliers. \n\n\u00b7 Elasticity of demand \u2013 concentration ratios do not factor in the elasticity of demand and the availability of substitutes. Many highly-concentrated industries (metals, airlines, et al) are constrained by the availability and cost of substitute products and services. \n\n\u00b7 Imprecise definitions \u2013 a narrowly-defined industry will appear to be more concentrated than a more broadly-defined industry. Suppose we were looking at concentration within the shoe industry. Should the market be simply \"shoes\", or do we break that down further into \"athletic shoes\", \"men's shoes\", \"children's shoes\", etc.?\n\nCoordinating Economic Activity\nEconomic activity can be coordinated by markets or by individual firms. A firm organizes input production factors so as to produce and market goods and/or services.\n\nAuto manufacturers are actually assemblers of cars - most the parts in a car are produced by hundreds of component suppliers. This is an example of market coordination. If General Motors decides to coordinate all activities associated with brake components, then the coordination is being done by that firm. A firm will decide to coordinate a particular type of economic activity when it can do so more efficiently than what is provided by the market.\n\nFirms can be more efficient than markets due to:\n\n\u00b7 Economies of scope - this applies when a firm hires specialized resources that can produce a broad range of goods and services. For example, a person with a difficult to diagnose medical condition would probably be sent to a hospital, which will have a broad range of medical specialists and diagnostic equipment.\n\n\u00b7 Economies of scale - for many types of goods, per unit production costs decline as larger volumes of output are produced by an individual firm.\n\n\u00b7 Team production can often lower production costs.\n\n\u00b7 Transaction costs are often reduced when economic activity is coordinated by a firm. Suppose you want to perform a major remodeling of your house. If you decide to coordinate the work yourself, you will have significant transaction costs associated with hiring qualified personnel such as plumbers and carpenters, monitoring their work, negotiating contracts with them, finding suitable building materials, arranging for delivery of materials and coordinating work schedules of the various subcontractors. If you hire a building firm or general contractor to coordinate the work, they probably will have lower transaction costs because they already will have knowledge of suitable subcontractors in the area and how best to get building materials. By hiring a general contractor, you will reduce your transaction costs by only having to negotiate one contract. \n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_70", "text": "\n\nThe \"Short Run\"\nThe short run is a time period so short that the firm cannot alter some production factors (typically these factors include the size and/or number of plants, the technology used, equipment and the management organization). Those factors are sometimes referred to collectively as the \"plant\". The firm usually can increase output in the short run by adding variable inputs. Labor is the most common variable input.\n\nThe \"Long Run\"\nIn the long run, firms have sufficient time to adjust to any and all production factors. Factories can be expanded, shrunk, demolished or built. The firm can leave or enter an industry.\n\nSuppose a car manufacture decides to build a new plant to build SUVs. This would be an example of a decision made in the long run. If that manufacturer decided to expand output by having employees work overtime, then that would be an example of a short-run decision.\n\n\n\n\n\nLook Out!\r\n\t\t\t\tDifferences between the \"short run\" and the \"long run\", and the concept of economic profit are critical to understanding economics!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal Product: The total product is the total quantity of goods produced, in association with specified levels of input. \n\nMarginal Product: The marginal product is the change in output that occurs when one more unit of input (such as a unit of labor) is added.\n\nAverage Product: The average product is the total product divided by the number of input units, usually a variable input such as labor.\n\nExample:\nSuppose only one worker was present at an assembly plant and that worker  had to do all functions of the plant - order and stock supplies, assemble the good, provide maintenance for the factory, prepare the good for shipping, etc. If a second worker is added, there may be a larger increase in productivity, as the two workers can allocate the tasks according to their abilities, and less  time will be lost going to and from various locations in the plant.\n\nA possible schedule of plant output could be as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this example, hiring the fourth worker increases output by 110 units, which is not as large as the increase created by hiring the third worker.\n\nThe cost of all production factors is equal to the firm's total cost (TC). Total fixed costs (TFC) include all fixed costs, while total variable costs (TVC) include the cost of all variable inputs such as labor. Marginal cost is the increase in costs associated with producing additional output. At some point in time, marginal costs will begin to increase because each additional worker contributes less to total output. The average fixed cost (AFC) is the fixed cost per unit of output, while the average variable cost (AVC) specifies the variable cost per unit of output. AFC and AVC combined are equal to the average total cost (ATC). As production increases, average fixed cost (total fixed cost divided by quantity) will decrease. When marginal cost exceeds average total cost, average total costs will go up, at which point the firm must receive higher prices if higher production is to occur.\n\nThe table below assumes that the firm has fixed costs of $1,000 per day, each worker is paid $200 per day, and each unit produced has variable material costs of $1 per unit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the table above we can see that both average total cost and marginal cost initially decrease as production increase, but both start going up at certain levels of production.\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_71", "text": "\nCost Curves\nThe short-run marginal cost (MC) curve will at first decline and then will go up at some point, and will intersect the average total cost and average variable cost curves at their minimum points.\n\nThe average variable cost (AVC) curve will go down (but will not be as steep as the marginal cost), and then go up. This will not go up as fast as the marginal cost curve.\n\nThe average fixed cost (AFC) curve will decline as additional units are produced, and continue to decline.\n\nThe average total cost (ATC) curve initially will decline as fixed costs are spread over a larger number of units, but will go up as marginal costs increase due to the law of diminishing returns.\n\nThe graph below illustrates the shapes of these curves.\n\nFigure 3.8: Cost Curves\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiminishing Returns and Diminishing Marginal Product of Capital\r\nThe law of diminishing returns states that as one type of production input is added, with all other types of input remaining the same, at some point production will increase at a diminishing rate.\n\nThere may be levels of input where increasing inputs causes production to go up at an increasing rate. However, according to the law of diminishing returns, at some point production will go up at a decreasing rate.\n\nThe marginal product of capital is the increase in total output associated with an increase in capital, while holding the quantity of labor constant. Capital is also subject to the law of diminishing returns.\n\nEconomies of Scale\nEconomies of scale mean that goods can be produced at a lower cost per good, as the quantity produced increases. Large-scale factory operations can permit the most efficient specialization of machinery and labor. Average fixed costs will decline as costs such as advertising can be spread across more and more units. \nDiseconomies of Scale\nDiseconomies of scale occur when per unit costs go up as output is increased. A typical reason given is bureaucratic inefficiencies - more attention may be given to administrative rules as opposed to innovation. Worker motivation is also more difficult as the number of employees increases.\n\nWhen economies of scale occur, the long-run average total cost (LRAC) curve will be declining; with diseconomies of scale, the LRAC curve will be rising.\n\nFigure 3.9: Long Run Average Total Curve\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_72", "text": "\nA purely competitive (price taker) market exists when the following conditions occur:\n\n\nLow entry and exit barriers - there are no restraints on firms entering or exiting the market\n\nHomogeneity of products - buyers can purchase the good from any seller and receive the same good\n\nPerfect knowledge about product quality, price, and cost\n\nNo single buyer or seller is large enough to influence the market price\n\nSellers must take the existing market price; if they set a price above the market price, no one will buy their product because potential buyers simply will go to other suppliers. Setting a price below the market price does not make any sense because the firm can sell as much as it wants to at the market price; selling below the market price will just reduce profits.\n\nBecause sellers must take the current market price a purely competitive market is also called a \"price takers\" market.\n\nThe firm can sell as much as it can produce at the existing market price, so demand is not a constraint for the firm. Revenue will be simply the market price multiplied by quantity produced.\n\nMaximizing Profit in Perfect Competition\nA price taker can sell as much as it can produce at the existing market price.\n\nSo total revenue (TR) will be simply P \u00d7 Q, where P = price and Q = quantity sold.\n\nMarginal revenue (MR), the increase in total revenue for production of one additional unit, will always be equal to the market price for a price taker.\n\nIf the market price of a good is $15, and a firm produces 10 units of a good per day, then its total revenue for the day will be $15 \u00d7 10 = $150. The marginal revenue associated with producing an eleventh unit per day would be the market price, $15; total revenue per day would increase from $150 to $165 (11 \u00d7 $15).\n\nMarginal costs will vary, depending upon the quantity produced. We would expect the firm to increase input up to the point where marginal cost is equal to the market price. In the short run, a firm will produce as long as its average variable costs do not exceed the market price. If the market price is less than the firm's total average cost, but greater than its average variable cost, then the firm will still operate in the short run. Its losses will be lowered by producing, since nothing can be done about fixed costs in the short run. Over the long run, the firm will need to cover all of it costs if it is to keep on producing.\n\nIf the market price at least covers the firm's variable costs, it may make sense to keep on operating. Any price in excess of the average variable cost will at least help to cover the fixed cost. Unless the firm decides to completely leave the business, it will come out ahead by continuing to operate.\n\nIf the market price is below the firm's average variable cost, it will not make sense for the firm to operate as it will lose even more money. If the firm believes that business conditions will improve, it will temporarily shut down. Seasonal businesses such as ski resorts or restaurants located by vacation areas will shut down temporarily at certain times. Manufacturers temporarily might shut down a factory and plan to reopen the factory when business conditions improve.\n\nWhen Does a Firm Maximize Profit in Perfect Competition?\nProfit (\u03c0) is equal to total revenue minus total cost. We can express this mathematically by stating:\n\u03c0 = TR - TC \n\nIn terms of calculus, we can state that profit will be maximized when the first derivative of the profit function is equal to zero:\n\nd\u03c0 = dTR\u00a0 -dTC= 0\ndQ dQ dQ\n\nWe also can rearrange the terms to state that profit maximization occurs when:\n\nFormula 3.4\n\ndTR = dTC\ndQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 dQ\n\nThe term on the left represents the change in revenue from producing one more unit, which is called marginal revenue. The term on the right represents the change in total costs resulting from producing one more unit, which is marginal cost.\n\nThe firm's profit will be maximized at the level of output whereby the marginal (additional) revenue received from the last unit produced is just equal to the marginal (additional) cost incurred by producing that last unit. Maximum profit for the firm occurs at the output level where MR = MC.\n\nFor a firm operating in a competitive environment, the marginal revenue received is always equal to the market price. Therefore a firm operating under perfect competition will always produce at the level of output where the marginal cost of the last unit produced is just equal to the market price.\n\nThe following equation will hold:\n\nFormula 3.5\n\r\nMR = MC = P\n\n\n\n\nExam Tip!\r\n\t\t\t\tYou do not need to know calculus for the CFA level I exam. Just make sure you understand the relationship above.\n\n\n\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_73", "text": "\nThe Firm vs. the Industry's Short-Run Supply Curve\nA company will continue to produce output until marginal revenue (MR) is equal to marginal cost (MC).\n\nIn other words, the condition for maximum profit occurs where:\nMR = MC\n\nAnother condition for profit to be maximized, because it is possible that MR=MC at a point where MC is falling, is that the marginal cost curve must be rising. Therefore, the supply curve for a competitive firm will be that part of the marginal cost curve which lies above the low point of the average cost curve. The supply curve slopes upward because marginal costs increase with the greater quantity supplied in the short run. With a competitive market, the supply curve will be a summation of the individual firms' supply curves.\n\nLong-Run Effects on Equilibrium \nIn the short-run, increases (decreases) in demand in a competitive market will cause prices and output to increase (decrease). \n\nIn the long-run, increases (decreases) in demand in a competitive market will cause increases (decreases) in output. Initially, markets with an increase (decrease) in demand will have firms experiencing economic profits (losses). Over time, markets with firms experiencing economic profits (losses) will have additional firms enter (existing firms will exit) the market, and prices will decrease (increase) towards previous levels. If cost conditions remain the same, then prices will revert to what they were before the increase (decrease) in demand.\n\nIf the market price falls below a firm's average total cost, the firm will incur economic losses. The firm may be able to lower its average total cost by changing to a different plant size. Suppose a firm increases its plant size, and lowers its average total costs. If other firms follow, then the industry supply curve will shift to the right. This will result in lower prices and less economic profit.\n\nIf a firm does not expect market conditions to improve then it may decide to go out of business. This would be the preferred option as, by selling out, neither fixed nor variable costs would be incurred.\n\nImpact From Changes in Technology\nThe impact of a permanent change of demand on price and output for a market will be influenced by the cost structure of suppliers in the market. The long-run market supply curve in a competitive industry will depend on the returns to scale.\n\nFor a constant-cost industry, if demand increases, then firms temporarily will make a profit as price will go above the minimum needed for the firms to stay in business. This will cause firms to expand output or new firms to enter the industry. Because costs are constant in the long run, the long-run supply curve will be horizontal. In the graph below, as demand shifts from D1 to D2, over the long run quantity will increase from Q1 to Q2. However, price will remain the same.\n\nFigure 3.12: Long Run Supply: Constant Cost Industry\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor an increasing cost industry, if demand increases, firms will need higher prices over the long run in order to justify higher levels of production. For example, prices for raw materials used in the industry may go up with higher levels of production, which will force the long-run supply curve to slope upward.\n\nFigure 3.10: Long Run Supply: Increasing Cost Industry\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor a decreasing cost industry, if demand increases, in the long run firms can provide more output at lower prices. The need to produce larger quantities of goods and services in response to increased demand induces technological change, which lowers costs for the producer and these savings are passed on to consumers in the long run.\n\nFigure 3.11: Long Run Supply: Decreasing Cost Industry\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_74", "text": "\nA monopoly is the single seller of a good for which substitutes are not readily available. There should be high barriers to entry; i.e. other firms cannot enter the market easily and provide the good.\n\nMonopolies often are created due to legal barriers. Patent laws grant inventors the exclusive right to produce and sell a product for a period of time (typically 17 years in the United States). Licensing restrictions often limit who is allowed to provide a good or service in a particular geographic area.\n\nIn some instances, economies of scale exist so that there is a tendency toward a natural monopoly - one firm can provide the good most efficiently. One traditional example is the distribution of electrical power to a local community. Duplication of power lines within a community would increase overall costs. With natural monopolies, government policy to encourage more entrants may not make sense.\n\nTo some degree, natural monopolies occur in the computer industry, where customers want to adhere to a common standard. The common standard for personal computer operating systems is provided by Microsoft. Alternative operating systems for personal computers (such as LINUX) do not make sense for most consumers, so Microsoft has considerable monopoly power.\n\nThe Monopolist and Profit Maximization\nThe monopolist has control both over the quantity produced and price charged; it also faces the entire demand curve for the good produced. Therefore, it will face a downward-sloping demand curve. It follows the general rule for profit maximization, MR = MC. As the monopolist does not know exactly how much consumers are willing to buy at particular prices, it must \"search\" for the optimum price.\n\nFigure 3.12: Monopolist Profit Maximization\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs shown in the graph above, a monopolist facing demand curve D0 will produce quantity Q0 and the price charged will be equal to P0. \n\nWhat happens if the monopolist later faces a demand curve such as D1? In that case, the monopolist cannot cover costs and will go out of business. \n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_75", "text": "\n\nMonopolies vs. Perfect Competitions\nA market characterized by monopoly has only a single seller, while a perfectly competitive market has many sellers. There are high barriers of entry with the monopoly, but little to no barriers to entry in the perfectly competitive market. Because the product of a monopolist cannot be substituted readily, the monopolist can set a higher price and still get sales. The seller in a perfectly competitive market cannot get a higher price because potential buyers always can get the product from other sellers.\n\nMajor inefficiencies associated with monopolies include:\n\n\u00b7Allocative inefficiency - prices will tend to be higher, and output lower, than what would exist in a market with low barriers to entry. Prices will tend to be higher than both marginal costs and average total cost. \n\n\u00b7Weakened market forces - when consumers of a product have many alternatives, producers must serve their customers efficiently in order to stay in business. If consumers can't purchase competitive products easily, the monopolist doesn't need to worry a lot about losing customers when poor service or a poor quality good is provided.\n\n\u00b7Rent or favor seeking - firms and/or individuals will put a great deal of effort into obtaining or maintaining high entry barriers; by doing so, they hope to achieve monopoly-type profits. Such efforts enrich some people, at the expense of many others.\n\nPrice Discrimination\nPrice searchers effectively price discriminate among their customers when they are able to:\n\r\na) identify sub-groups which have different elasticities of demand, and\r\nb) ensure that the customers cannot resell the good.\n\r\nA common example is airline travel. Travelers who plan in advance will have a higher elasticity of demand than travelers who must travel within a short period of time.\n\nWith price discrimination, some consumers pay higher prices than they would if there was a single price. However, many in the group paying lower prices will now be getting something they otherwise would not have purchased. Universities are increasing their use of price discrimination. Tuition rates for students without financial aid are increasing greatly while the average price charged is not going up as much because more financial aid is being offered. The colleges reap high revenues from wealthy families who can afford to pay high tuition while more students from lower-income families can now attend college.\n\nIn general, higher output will occur with price discrimination. Furthermore, there may be some businesses that could not exist without price discrimination. For example, a dentist in a small town may not have a viable business without performing price discrimination.\n\nAs price discrimination increases output and gains from trade, it reduces allocative inefficiency. Firms that successfully price discriminate will benefit by getting higher revenues.\n\nWhy Do Monopolies Exist?\nIf a natural monopoly is to exist, the government can regulate the price and output. In the graph below, the monopolist would prefer to charge price P1 and Q1 to maximize profits. A regulatory agency will often set the price at P2. At this price, the monopolist receives enough to cover costs and, in effect, it receives a competitive rate or return of its capital. The benefits to society from the increased production outweigh the increased costs to the monopolist.\n\nFigure 3.13: Results of Regulating Price and Output\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_76", "text": "\nA firm engaged in monopolistic competition which is considering reducing prices in order to increase total revenue has two conflicting factors to consider. Reducing prices will increase the quantity of a good sold, but the reduction in price will also apply to quantities of the good that would have been sold at a higher price.\n\nThe price searcher can maximize profit by adjusting output and the price until marginal revenue is equal to marginal cost. Notice that the marginal revenue curve lies below the firm's demand curve.\n\nFigure 3.15: Marginal Revenue Curve In Monopolistic Competition\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe phrase \"contestable markets\" describes markets where there are few sellers, but they behave in a competitive manner because of the threat of new entrants. For instance, an airline may serve a particular route exclusively, but does not charge excessive prices because those prices would entice additional airlines to offer that route.\n\nGovernment regulation is often used to keep new firms out of markets. Economists generally favor deregulation as this helps to keep prices low.\n\nPrices over the long run in a competitive market will move to the lowest point of the firm's average total cost curve. We then have allocative efficiency because desired goods are produced at the lowest possible cost.\n\nBecause price searchers face downward-sloping demand curves, the price they charge will exceed the firm's marginal cost. The price charged and the quantity produced will not be where the firm minimizes average total costs. Figure 3.16 illustrates these points.\n\nFigure 3.16: Monopolistic Competition: Low Barriers to Entry\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe monopolistic competition market, in comparison to a purely competitive market, will have a higher price and lower output. Some argue that this is a good trade-off, as consumers benefit from having a variety of goods. Advertising would be not be used by price-takers, but is used by price-searchers; as the cost of advertising is ultimately borne by consumers, it is an argument against the price-searcher market. If barriers to entry are low, firms still have an incentive to produce efficiently, use resources only if they add value and innovate by altering their products or offering new products. Entrepreneurs may have more incentives with price searcher markets, while if markets are contestable, prices will not be excessively higher than those in competitive markets.\n\nProduct Development and Marketing in Monopolistic Competition\nFirms engaged in monopolistic competition invest in product development and marketing so as to differentiate themselves from other firms in the industry. By doing so, they hope to gain more monopolistic pricing power. Since advertising increases costs, it will shift supply curves up and to the right. Ultimately, over the long run, consumers pay for the advertising in the form of higher prices.\n\nIn comparison to the pure competitive market, prices will be higher and quantities produced will be lower when there is monopolistic competition. However, there will be a greater variety of goods. This may be a worthwhile tradeoff. \n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_77", "text": "\n\nWhat is an Oligopoly?\nOligopoly refers to a market with \"few sellers\". Oligopolies interact among themselves. When an oligopolist changes a price, it must take into account how other firms in the industry will respond. Within an oligopoly, the products can be similar or differentiated. Oligopoly markets have high barriers to entry.\n\nThe Prisoner's Dilemma\nThe \"prisoners' dilemma\" was first described in the field of \"game theory\", which is a branch of applied mathematics and economics dealing with choices made under conflict and uncertainty. Suppose that the police believe Dave and Henry have committed a felony, but the evidence is weak. The police have placed Dave and Henry in jail, in separate cells. The police need the confession of at least one of the prisoners in order to get a felony conviction. If neither prisoner confesses, then the police can only convict them on a minor charge with a three-month prison term. Each prisoner is offered the following deal: if one testifies against the other while the other remains the silent, the one who testifies will not be convicted of anything, while the one who remains silent will go to jail for 20 years. If both confess, then each will receive a five-year jail term.\n\nTo sum up the situation:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe optimum result for the two together is to stay silent, in which Dave and Henry will each get only three months prison time. However, each prisoner does not have knowledge of what the other prisoner will do. The most rational response from the individual is to confess. If the other prisoner stays silent, then that person gets off free; if the other prisoner confesses, then the prison term will be less (five years vs. 20 years).\n\nThe prisoners' dilemma illustrates a situation in which individuals arrive at a non-optimal solution, due to a lack of cooperation and trust. A similar situation occurs with oligopolies. If firms within an oligopolistic industry have cooperation and trust with each other, then they can theoretically maximize industry profits by setting a monopolistic price. Firms would then have to figure out how to fairly divide up the profits.\n\nIf oligopolies collude successfully, they will set price and output such that MR = MC for the industry overall. In figure 3.17 on the following page, this is depicted as Pa and Qa. Without collusion, firms will lower prices to attract more customers. Gradually, the price and output will move to Pb and Qb, which is identical to what would be achieved with a competitive market.\n\nFigure 3.16: Oligopolist Profit Maximization\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOligopolies have strong incentives to collude because while acting together, they can restrict output and set prices so that economic profits are earned. The individual oligopolist has an incentive to cheat because the firm's demand curve is more elastic than the overall market demand curve. By secretly lowering prices, the firm can sell to customers who would not buy at the higher price, as well as to customers who normally buy from the other firms.\n\nOligopolistic agreements tend to be unstable due to these conflicting tendencies. \n\nObstacles to collusion within oligopolies include: \n\nLow Entry Barriers - Particularly as time goes on, more firms will be attracted to the potential economic profits, which will not be sustainable. For example, the OPEC's raising of oil prices during the 1970s and early 1980s enticed more non-OPEC producers to produce more. The market share of OPEC producers was drastically reduced and they had to reduce prices in order to gain market share. In the long run, cartels are not usually successful at raising prices.\n\nAntitrust Laws - these laws prohibit collusion. Although firms may make secret agreements, those agreements will not be enforceable in a court of law.\n\nUnstable Demand Conditions - These conditions will make collusion more difficult, as firms are more likely to have disagreements as to what is the best direction for the industry. Some may expect large increases in demand, while others may disagree and prefer that industry capacity remains the same.\n\nIncreasing Number of Firms - An increasing number of firms in an oligopolistic industry will make agreements harder to discuss, negotiate and enforce. Differences of opinion are more likely. As the number of firms in the industry increases, the industry will behave more like a competitive market.\n\nDifficulties with Detecting and Stopping Price Cuts - These difficulties will undermine effective collusion. Sometimes oligopolistic firms will cheat by enacting quality improvements, easier credit terms and free shipping. If quality changes can be used to compete, collusive price agreements will not be effective.\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_78", "text": "\nWithin this Section we have focused on the basics of microeconomics, the properties of demand and supply, price takers and searchers, and demand and supply for resources and capital.

However, we recommend reviewing this material as you will need to know it in order to understand the more advanced topics discussed later.\n\nGross Domestic Product (GDP) and Gross National Product (GNP)\nGross Domestic Product (GDP) and Gross National Product (GNP) are the two most common measures of a nation's economic output.\n\nGross domestic product is defined as the value of all goods and services produced within a nation during a particular period of time (typically a year). Market prices are used to determine value and only \"final\" goods and services (those consumed by the end user) are included.\n\nGross National Productmeasures the income of all of a nation's citizens, even if that income was earned abroad. Amounts that foreigners earn within the nation's boundaries are not included. \n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_80", "text": "\nTwo different approaches are used to calculate GDP. In theory, the amount spent for goods and services should be equal to the income paid to produce the goods and services, and other costs associated with those goods and services. Calculating GDP by adding up expenditures is called the expenditure approach, and computing GDP by examining income for resources (sometimes referred to as gross domestic income, or GDI, is known as the resource cost/income approach.\n\nExpenditure Approach\nThe expenditure approach utilizes four main components:\n\nConsumption (C) - These are personal consumption expenditures. They are typically broken down into the following categories: durable goods, non-durable goods, and services.\n\nInvestment (I) - This is gross private investment; it is generally broken down into fixed investment and changes in business inventories.\n\nGovernment (G) - This category includes government spending on items that are \"consumed\" in the current period, such as office supplies and gasoline; and also capital goods, such as highways, missiles, and dams. Note that transfer payments are not included in GDP, as they are not part of current production.\n\nNet Exports - This is calculated by subtracting a nations imports (M)from exports (X). Imports are goods and services produced outside the country and consumed within, and exports are goods and services produced domestically and sold to foreigners. Note that this number may be negative, which has occurred in the U.S. for the last several years. Net exports for the U.S. were minus $606 billion during calendar year 2004 (as per Bureau of Economic Analysis, U.S. Department of Commerce June 29, 2005 press release).\n\nFormula 4.1\n\nGDP = C + I + G + (X - M)\n\nResource Cost/Income Approach\nTo calculate Gross Domestic Income (GDI), first consider how revenues received for products and services are used: \n\n1. Pay for the labor used (wages + income of self-employed proprietors) \n2. Pay for the use of fixed resources, such as land and buildings (rent); \n\n3. Pay a return to capital employed (interest); \n\n4.Pay for the replenishment of raw material used.\n\nRemaining revenues go to business owners as a residual cash flow, which is used to replenish capital (depreciation), or it becomes a business profit. So with the resource cost/income approach, GDP (or GDI) is calculated as wages, rent, interest and cash flow paid to business owners or organizers of production.\n\nSo GDP by resource cost/income approach = wages + self-employment income + Rent + Interest + profits + indirect business taxes + depreciation + net income of foreigners.\n\nFormula 4.2\nGDI = wages + self-employment income + Rent + Interest + profits\r\n+ indirect business taxes + depreciation + net income of foreigners\n\nThe above formula is probably hard to memorize, so at least try to remember this relationship - GDI = wages + rent + interest + business cash flow\n\nTotal GDP figures should be the same by either method of calculation. But in real life, things don't always work out this way. Official figures usually have a category called \"statistical discrepancy\", which is needed to balance out the two approaches.\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_81", "text": "\nThe main difference between nominal and real values is that real values are adjusted for inflation, while nominal values are not. As a result, nominal GDP will often appear higher than real GDP.\n\r\nNominal values of GDP (or other income measures) from different time periods can differ due to changes in quantities of goods and services and/or changes in general price levels. As a result, taking price levels (or inflation) into account is necessary when determining if we are really better or worse off when making comparisons between different time periods. Values for real GDP are adjusted for differences in prices levels, while figures for nominal GDP are not.\n\nThe GDP Deflator\nThe GDP deflator is an economic metric that converts output measured at current prices into constant-dollar GDP. This includes prices for business and government goods and services, as well as those purchased by consumers. This calculation shows how much a change in the base year's GDP relies upon changes in the price level.\n\nIf we wish to analyze the impact of price changes throughout an economy, then the GDP deflator is the preferred price index. This is because it does not focus on a fixed basket of goods and services and automatically reflects changes in consumption patterns and/or the introduction of new goods and services.\n\nReal GDP for a given year, in relation to a \"base\" year, is computed by multiplying the nominal GDP for a given year by the ratio of the GDP price deflator in the base year to the GDP price deflator for the given year.\n\nExample:\nSuppose we wish to calculate the real GDP for the year 2001 in terms of 1996 dollars. The value for (note that these values are for illustration purposes only) 1996 price deflator is 100 and the 2001 price deflator is 115. The 2001 GDP in nominal terms is $10 trillion dollars.\n\nThen: Real GDP year 2001 in 1996 dollars =$10 trillion \u00d7 (100 / 115) = $8.6 trillion \n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_82", "text": "\nThere are many limitations to using GDP as a way to measure current income and production. Major ones include:\n\n\u00b7Changes in quality and the inclusion of new goods - higher quality and/or new products often replace older products. Many products, such as cars and medical devices, are of higher quality and offer better features than what was available previously. Many consumer electronics, such as cell phones and DVD players, did not exist until recently. \n\u00b7Leisure/human costs - GDP does not take into account leisure time, nor is consideration given to how hard people work to produce output. Also, jobs are now safer and less physically strenuous than they were in the past. Because GDP does not take these factors into account, changes in real income could be understated.\n\n\u00b7Underground economy - Barter and cash transactions that take place outside of recorded marketplaces are referred to as the underground economy and are not included in GDP statistics. These activities are sometimes legal ones that are undertaken so as to avoid taxes and sometimes they are outright illegal acts, such as trafficking in illegal drugs. \n\n\u00b7Harmful Side Effects - Economic \"bads\", such as pollution, are not included in GDP statistics. While no subtractions to GDP are made for their harmful effects, market transactions made in an effort to correct the bad effects are added to GDP.\n\n\u00b7Non-Market Production - Goods and services produced but not exchanged for money, known as \"nonmarket production\", are not measured, even though they have value. For instance, if you grow your own food, the value of that food will not be included in GDP. If you decide to watch TV instead of growing your own food and now have to purchase it, then the value of your food will be included in GDP.\n\nAlternative Measures of Domestic Income\nOther than GDP and GNP, there are alternative measures of domestic income, such as national income, personal income and disposable personal income.\n\nNational Income\nNational income is computed by subtracting indirect business taxes, the net income of foreigners, and depreciation from GDP. It represents the income earned by a country's citizens. National income can also be computed by summing interest, rents, employee compensation (wages and benefits), proprietors' income and corporate profits.\n\n\u00b7Personal income represents income available for personal use. It is computed by making various adjustments to national income. Social insurance taxes and corporate profits are subtracted from national income, while net interest, corporate dividends and transfer payments are added.\n\n\u00b7Disposable personal income (or disposable income) is income available to people after taxes; i.e., it is personal income less individual taxes.\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_83", "text": "\n\nI. Components of Marginal Product and Marginal Revenue\n\nMarginal Product\nThe marginal product is the change in output that occurs when one more unit of input (such as a unit of labor) is added.\n\nMarginal Revenue\nMarginal revenue is the increase in total revenue that occurs with the production of one more unit of output.\n\nValue of Marginal Product\nFor a particular resource, the value of marginal product (VMP) is the resource's marginal product multiplied by the product price.\n\nMarginal Revenue Product\nThe marginal revenue product of a resource is defined as the increase in a firm's total revenue attributable to employing one more unit of that resource. The increase in output due to adding one more resource unit is called the marginal product. The marginal revenue product is calculated as the marginal product times the marginal revenue.\n\nThe Relationship Between MRP and Demand\nDue to the law of diminishing returns, we expect that both the marginal product and the marginal revenue product for an input will decline as more of the input is deployed.\n\nA firm seeking to maximize profit will increase employment of a variable input unit until the MRP of that input is just equal to what it pays for the input. This rule will be followed by price takers and price searchers.\n\nAs the price of an input goes up, fewer units of that resource will generate the MRP needed to entice the firm to employ that resource. The demand curve for a resource will be downward sloping, as shown in figure 4.1 below:\n\nFigure 4.1: Results of Regulating Price and Output\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nValues for the demand curve will depend upon the price of the good being produced, the productivity of the resource in question, and the amount of other resources used by the firm.\n\nA profit-maximizing firm will continue to employ units of a resource as long as the MRP associated with the unit exceeds the firm's cost. If we assume the units of each resource are perfectly divisible, then the following conditions will apply to a firm with 3 production inputs (A, B, and C).\n\nMRPa=Pa\n\nMRPb =Pb\n\nMRPc= Pc\n\nPa is equal to the price (or wage rate) of resource A, Pb is equal to the price (or wage rate) of resource B, and Pc is equal to the price (or wage rate) of resource C.\n\nSuppose resource A represents highly skilled labor and resource B represents labor with low skills. If a firm can get 100 units of additional output by purchasing $500 worth of highly skilled labor and only 50 additional units of output by hiring $500 worth of labor with low skills, then per unit costs will be reduced by hiring the highly-skilled labor. Expenses can always be reduced by substituting resources with relatively high marginal product per dollar spent for resources that have a relatively low marginal product per dollar. This substitution will continue to occur if per unit costs are to be minimized until the following relationship is achieved:\n\nMRPa = MRPb = MRPcinan\n-------- -------- --------\nPa  Pb  Pc\n\nNote that this relationship also implies that if skilled laborers are three times as productive as unskilled labor, then firms will be willing to pay skilled laborers three times as much as unskilled labor. \n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_84", "text": "\n\nPhysical vs. Financial Capital\nThe term physical capital applies to the stock of buildings, equipment, instruments, raw materials, semi-finished and finished goods in inventory, and other physical objects used by a firm to produce its goods and/or services.\n\r\nFinancial capital includes the resources used to purchase those physical objects; those resources come from savings. Interest represents the price of capital; the actual market interest rate will be the rate at which the supply of capital is equal to the quantity of capital demanded.\n\nComparing the Future Marginal Revenue Product of Capital with Future Capital Prices\nA firm needs to examine the future marginal revenue product of capital when making a decision to employ more capital. The firm converts the value of those future income streams to a value in the present. Present value is the current worth of a future income stream, discounted to reflect the fact that a dollar in the future is worth less than a dollar today. The general form of the present value calculation is:\n\nFormula 4.2\n\npresent value = future value / (1 + r)\n\nWhere: \"r\" represents the relevant interest rate\n\nNote that if future value stays the same, and interest rates decrease, future value increases. As interest rates decline, more investments of capital become profitable to the firm, and the quantity of capital demanded will increase.\n\nMain Influences on the Demand & Supply of Capital\nThe main influences on the demand for capital are:\n\n\u00b7the interest rate\n\u00b7expectations concerning future business conditions - if firms believe that future business conditions will be poor, they will be less likely to make investments\n\nThe main influences on the supply of capital are:\n\n\u00b7the interest rate\n\u00b7income - as incomes increase, people generally save a larger proportion of their income\n\u00b7expectations about future income - if people expect their income to decline, then they will tend to save more now so as to even out their consumption. College students will tend not to be savers, as they usually expect their future incomes to be significantly higher than the present.\n\nThe equilibrium interest rate will tend to fluctuate over time. Population changes, technological changes, and expectations are some of the factors that will influence the demand and/or supply for capital.\n\nRenewable and Non-renewable Resources\nRenewable natural resources (a form of physical capital) are those resources that tend to be replenished by nature. Examples include water or solar energy. Non-renewable natural resources are not available (for practical purposes) once they are used. Examples include natural gas, oil, and coal.\n\nThe basic principle regarding the equilibrium for non-renewable natural resources is that the price of the resource today should be equal to the present value of the next period's expected price for the same resource. Essentially, the prices for a non-renewable resource are expected to increase at a rate equal to the interest rate.\n\nSuppose an oil producer expects prices for oil to be lower in the future. A profit-maximizing oil producer would try to sell as much oil in the present, and then invest the proceeds. If the price of oil is expected to increase at a rate greater than the interest rate, then the oil producer should let as much oil as possible stay in the ground.\n\nKeep in mind that prices for non-renewable resources do not exactly follow this pattern because the future is always uncertain. Technological changes and political uncertainties are some of the many factors that make forecasting price changes difficult. \n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_85", "text": "\n\nI. Economic Rent\n\nEconomic Differences of Small and Large Incomes\nThese differences are best explained by the concept of marginal revenue product, which we discussed earlier in the chapter. Remember that marginal revenue product of a resource is defined as the increase in a firm's total revenue attributable to employing one more unit of that resource. The increase in output due to adding one more resource unit is called the marginal product. The relationship between additional resources and output implies that skilled laborers are three times as productive as unskilled labor, and therefore, firms are willing to pay skilled laborers three times as much as unskilled labor.\n\nKeeping this in mind, workers with large incomes are associated with a high marginal revenue product, while those with small incomes are associated with a low marginal revenue product. For example, a star baseball pitcher (skilled labor) will have a high marginal revenue product, while a dishwasher (unskilled labor) will have a low marginal revenue product. Very few people are qualified to pitch in Major League Baseball, while there are many people qualified to wash dishes.\n\nEconomic Rent and Opportunity Costs\r\nEconomic rent is the difference between what an owner of a factor of production (such as land, capital or labor) receives and the opportunity cost for that owner.\n\r\nLet's suppose the factor of production is labor. In this example, the laborer receives $20/per hour for their job, and the minimum salary they'd be willing to work for (opportunity cost) is $16/per hour. This $4/hour difference is the laborer's economic rent. In the case of the superstar baseball pitcher, most of the salary earned may be economic rent. Most of a wages of a dishwasher is opportunity cost, since these types of jobs pay minimum wage.If the factor of production is a plot of land, the supply curve would be perfectly vertical, since there is no way for the landowner to supply additional land. In this case, all money received is economic rent. \n\nThe size of economic rent received by a owner of a factor of production is determined by the elasticity of supply for that particular good or service.\n\n\nIf the elasticity of supply is neither elastic nor inelastic, the supply curve will slope upward and the supplier's income would be split between economic rent and opportunity cost. \n\nIf the elasticity of supply is inelastic, the supply curve would be perfectly vertical and the supplier's entire income would be comprised of economic rent. For example, if the supply were a particular plot of land, or a \n\nIf the elasticity of supply is elastic, the supply curve would be perfectly horizontal, and the supplier's entire income would be comprised of opportunity cost.\n\n\n\n\n\nLook Out!\r\n\t\t\t\tDo not confuse \"economic rent\" with \"rent\". The rent paid each month to live in an apartment, or to lease a car is not the same.

The Business Cycle\n\nPhases of the Business Cycle\nEconomies usually have long-term secular trends, such as a certain rate of expansion for the labor force and/or the general population. One feature of market economies is that economic activity sometimes rises above the long-term trend line, while at other times it falls below.\n\nFigure 4.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA business peak, or boom, occurs when unemployment is low, incomes are high and businesses are operating at full capacity. When aggregate economic conditions began to slow, the business cycle is said to be in a contraction, or recessionary phase. Sales begin to fall, and unemployment starts to rise. The low point of the contraction phase is called the recessionary trough. The business cycle begins the expansionary phase after the low point is reached and business conditions began to improve. Business sales improve, and the unemployment rate begins to decline. Another boom will follow, and the cycle will begin anew.\n\nConditions during the low point are referred to as a recession. Many economists define a recession as being a decline in Gross Domestic Product over two or more quarters. Severe recessions (both in length of time and severity of the contraction) are referred to as depressions. \n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_87", "text": "\nThe civilian labor force is defined as those who have jobs or are seeking a job, are at least 16 years old and are not serving in the military. A person who does not have a job, is available for work and is actively seeking work is considered to be unemployed.\n\nKey labor market indicators include:\n\n\nThe Labor Force Participation Rate - This rate is calculated by dividing the number of people in the civilian labor force by the total civilian population of those 16 years old or older.\n\nThe Unemployment Rate - This is computed by dividing the number of unemployed by the number of people in the civilian labor force. That number is multiplied by 100 and expressed as a percentage. Part-time workers are considered to be employed.\n\nThe Employment/Population Ratio - This ratio is calculated by dividing the number of job-holding civilians who are at least 16 years old by the total number of people in the civilian population within the same age group. This ratio will tend to go higher during economic booms and lower during recessions.\n\nThere are several issues with calculating the unemployment rate. The handling of discouraged workers is one point of contention. This phrase describes workers who are without a job but are not actively seeking a job because they have gotten discouraged about their job search. Such people would not be officially counted as unemployed, although this is a point of contention. Another area of dispute has to do with the inclusion of part-time workers as employed. Some believe that they should not be counted as employed, especially those who would prefer to work full-time. Due to definitional disputes with the unemployment rate, many economists prefer to use the employment/population ratio, which uses numbers that are easily measured and are well defined.\n\nGenerally unemployment is higher during a recession. Employment usually does not pick up until after the economy is coming out of a recession; it is usually regarded as a \"lagging indicator\" for the health of the economy.\n\nGDP, Real Wages and Aggregate Hours Worked\nWe cannot simply look at the number of people with jobs when examining the total quantity of labor in an economy. Some workers only have part-time jobs, while others work more than the standard work-week. Aggregate hours, which is the total number of hours worked by all employees, is a better measure of the quantity of labor.\n\nThe number of aggregate hours worked should increase with GDP. Data pertaining to aggregate hours in the United States is maintained by the U.S. Department of Labor Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nChanges in real wage rates can be calculate by dividing nominal wages by the GDP deflator. Data for real wages in the United States is also maintained by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. \n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_88", "text": "\nThe creation of \"full employment\" is a common economic policy goal. However, full employment does not imply zero unemployment. A dynamic economy will always have some unemployment; this is not necessarily harmful. Types of unemployment are often broken down as follows:\n\n\u00b7Structural Unemployment - Changes occur in market economies such that demand increases for some jobs skills while other job skills become outmoded and are no longer in demand. For example, the invention of the automobile increased demand for automobile mechanics and decreased demand for farriers (people who shoe horses).\n\n\u00b7Frictional Unemployment - This type of unemployment occurs because of workers who are voluntarily between jobs. Some are looking for better jobs. Due to a lack of perfect information, it takes times to search for the better job. Others may be moving to a different geographical location for personal reasons and time must be spent searching for a new position.\n\n\u00b7Cyclical Unemployment - This occurs due to downturns in overall business activity.\n\nAs previously noted, full employment does not equate to zero unemployment. Some unemployment is normal in a market economy and is actually expected as part of an efficient labor market. Full employment is defined as the level of employment that occurs when unemployment is normal, taking into account structural and frictional factors.\n\nThe natural rate of unemployment is that amount of unemployment that occurs naturally due to imperfect information and job shopping. It is the rate of unemployment that is expected when an economy is operating at full capacity. At this time in the U.S., the natural rate of unemployment is considered to be about 5%.\n\n\n\n\n\nLook Out!\r\n\t\t\t\tThe concepts of \"full employment\" and \"natural rate of unemployment\" are used extensively in macroeconomics - make sure you understand these concepts!\n\n\n\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_89", "text": "\n\nInflation\nInflation is defined as an increase in the overall price level. Please note that inflation does not apply to the price level of just one good, but rather to how prices are doing overall. A consumer facing inflation that occurs at the rate of 10% per year will able to buy 10% less goods at the end of the year if his or her income stays the same. Inflation can also be defined as a decline in the real purchasing power of the applicable currency.\n\nConsumer Price Index (CPI)\nThe CPI represents prices paid by consumers (or households). Prices for a basket of goods are compiled for a certain base period. Price data for the same basket of goods is then collected on a monthly basis. This data is used to compare the prices for a particular month with the prices from a different time period.\n\nExample:\nThe inflation rate is computed by subtracting the CPI of last year's prices from the CPI value for this year, dividing that difference by last year's CPI value and then multiplying by 100.\n\nSo if the value of the price index for the current year is equal to 165, and last year's value was 150, the rate would be calculated as:\n\nInflation rate = (165 - 150) X100= 10\n150\n\nCPI Sources of Bias\nThe CPI is not a perfect measure of inflation. Sources of bias include:\n\n\u00b7Quality adjustments - quality of many goods (e.g., cars, computers, and televisions) goes up every year. Although the Bureau of Labor Statistics is now making adjustments for quality improvements, some price increases may reflect quality adjustments that are still counted entirely as inflation.\n\n\u00b7New goods - new goods may be introduced that will be hard to compare to older substitutes.\n\n\u00b7Substitution - if the price goes up for one good, consumers may substitute another good that provides similar utility. A common example is beef vs. pork. If the price goes up, and the price of pork stays the same, consumers might easily switch to pork. Although the CPI will go higher due to the price increase in beef, many consumers may not be worse off.  Also, when prices go up, consumers may effectively not pay the higher prices by switching to discount stores. The CPI surveys do not check to see if consumers are substituting discount or outlet stores. \n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_90", "text": "\n\nThe Aggregate Supply Curve\nThe aggregate supply curve shows the relationship between a nation's overall price level, and the quantity of goods and services produces by that nation's suppliers. The curve is upward sloping in the short run and vertical, or close to vertical, in the long run.\n\nNet investment, technology changes that yield productivity improvements, and positive institutional changes can increase both short-run and long-run aggregate supply. Institutional changes, such as the provision of public goods at low cost, increase economic efficiency and cause aggregate supply curves to shift to the right.\n\nSome changes can alter short-run aggregate supply (SAS), while long-run aggregate supply (LAS) remains the same. Examples include: \n\n\nSupply Shocks - Supply shocks are sudden surprise events that increase or decrease output on a temporary basis. Examples include unusually bad or good weather or the impact from surprise military actions. \n\nResource Price Changes - These, too, can alter SAS. Unless the price changes reflect differences in long-term supply, the LAS is not affected. \n\nChanges in Expectations for Inflation - If suppliers expect goods to sell at much higher prices in the future, their willingness to sell in the current time period will be reduced and the SAS will shift to the left. \n\n\nThe Aggregate Demand Curve\nThe aggregate demand curve shows, at various price levels, the quantity of goods and services produced domestically that consumers, businesses, governments and foreigners (net exports) are willing to purchase during the period of concern. The curve slopes downward to the right, indicating that as price levels decrease (increase), more (less) goods and services are demanded.\n\nFactors that can shift an aggregate demand curve include: \n\n\nReal Interest Rate Changes - Such changes will impact capital goods decisions made by individual consumers and by businesses. Lower real interest rates will lower the costs of major products such as cars, large appliances and houses; they will increase business capital project spending because long-term costs of investment projects are reduced. The aggregate demand curve will shift down and to the right. Higher real interest rates will make capital goods relatively more expensive and cause the aggregate demand curve to shift up and to the left. \n\nChanges in Expectations - If businesses and households are more optimistic about the future of the economy, they are more likely to buy large items and make new investments; this will increase aggregate demand. \n\nThe Wealth Effect - If real household wealth increases (decreases), then aggregate demand will increase (decrease)\n\nChanges in Income of Foreigners - If the income of foreigners increases (decreases), then aggregate demand for domestically-produced goods and services should increase (decrease). \n\nChanges in Currency Exchange Rates - From the viewpoint of the U.S., if the value of the U.S. dollar falls (rises), foreign goods will become more (less) expensive, while goods produced in the U.S. will become cheaper (more expensive) to foreigners. The net result will be an increase (decrease) in aggregate demand. \n\nInflation Expectation Changes - If consumers expect inflation to go up in the future, they will tend to buy now causing aggregate demand to increase. If consumers' expectations shift so that they expect prices to decline in the future, t aggregate demand will decline and the aggregate demand curve will shift up and to the left.\n\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_91", "text": "\nIn the short-run, an unanticipated decrease in aggregate demand will lead to an excess supply of resources, which will lead to a decline in resource prices. Unemployment will increase, prices will go down and output will be reduced. Over a longer period of time, lower resource costs will cause a shift to the right in aggregate supply. The economy will move to producing a level of output consistent with full employment (as was the case before the decrease in aggregate demand), but at a lower price level.\n\nAn unanticipated increase in aggregate demand will, in the short-run, lead to an output level that is greater than what is consistent with full employment. This occurs because price levels are different that what was anticipated by resource providers. There will be less unemployment than the \"natural rate\" of unemployment. There will be upward pressure on resource prices and interest rates, which will, over the long-run, result in a decrease in aggregate demand. Resource providers will make adjustments to the new price levels and output will decline to what is consistent with full employment. A new market equilibrium will occur at a higher price level. So in the long-run, inflation (higher prices) will be the major effect of the increase in aggregate demand.\n\nIn the short-run, an unanticipated decrease in SAS will lower the availability of resources. This will lead to an increase in resource prices, which will in turn cause the aggregate supply curve of goods and services to shift up and to the left. A reduced level of output will be produced at higher prices. If the cause of the unanticipated decrease in SAS is temporary, then there should be no changes in prices or output over the long-run. If the cause is more important, then the long-run supply curve will shift to the left. The economy would produce a lower level output at higher prices.\n\nAn unanticipated increase in aggregate supply will, in the short-run, lead to a shift to the right in SAS. Output and income will expand beyond what is consistent with full employment at a lower price level. If what produced the increase in aggregate supply is only temporary, the SAS curve will return to normal levels and prices and output will be as before. If what produced the change is permanent, then both SAS and LAS will shift to the right. There will be a greater amount of output, at lower prices.\n\nSelf-Correcting Mechanisms\nThree aspects of a market economy that help to stabilize the economy and lessen the impact of economic shocks include:\n\n1.Changes in Resource Prices - If the economy is operating at less than full employment, there will be downward pressure on prices for labor and other resources. That effect will stimulate short-run aggregate supply. If the economy is operating above full employment, prices for labor and other resources will get bid up, and short-run aggregate supply will be reduced.\n\n2. Change in Real Interest Rates - During recessions, business demand for capital funding declines, causing a lowering of real interest rates. The lower interest rates in turn stimulate consumers to buy large items and cost of business investment projects are reduced, which stimulates business investment spending. Economic booms lead to higher interest rates, thereby lowering demand for consumer durable goods and funding for business investment projects. Therefore, interest rate movements work to stabilize aggregate demand.\n\n3.Relative Stability of Consumption - The permanent income hypotheses states that household consumption is mainly a function of expected long-range (permanent) income. Since long-run income has more of an impact on spending than temporary changes in current income, consumption spending stays relatively the same across business cycles. During economic boom times, consumers will increase their savings; during a recession, temporary declines in income will induce households to draw on their savings so as to maintain a level of consumption in line with their expected long-run incomes. \n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_92", "text": "\n\nClassical vs. Keynesian Economics\nUnder classical economic theory, an economy will always move towards equilibrium at full capacity and full employment. Aggregate demand will adjust to full potential GDP, assisted by flexible wages and prices. Desired savings are kept equal to desired investment by responses to interest rate changes.\n\nBritish economist John Maynard Keynes took the viewpoint that spending induces businesses to supply goods and services. If consumers become pessimistic about their futures and cut down on their spending, then business will reduce their production. He rejected the classical viewpoint that unemployment would be resolved by flexible wage rates; instead, wages are viewed as being \"sticky\" when downward pressures exist. Business will produce only the quantities of goods and services that government, consumers, investors and foreigners are expected to buy. If the planned expenditures are less than what would be associated with production at full employment, then output will be less than the economy's full potential.\n\nThe Four Components of the Keynesian Model\nThere are four components of planned aggregate expenditures in the Keynesian model: consumption, investment, government spending and net exports. Some basic assumptions about the Keynesian model should be noted. When the economy is operating at full employment capacity, then only the natural rate of unemployment is extant. Wages and prices are not flexible until full employment occurs; at that point, increases in demand will only cause prices to go higher.\n\n\nConsumption - Keynes believed that consumption expenditures are mainly influenced by the level of income. As income increases, consumption will increase but not by as much as the increase in income. The relation between consumption and income is known as the consumption function. \n\nInvestment - This category includes spending on fixed assets such as machinery, and changes in inventories of raw materials and final goods. Keynes believed that in the short run, investment spending is not a function of income. \n\nGovernment - As with investment, planned government expenditures are not a function of income. \n\nNet Exports - Exports remain constant and imports increase as aggregate income rises, so net exports (exports minus imports) will tend to go down as aggregate income goes up.\n\nFormula 4.3\n\nAggregate Demand = C + I + G + (X - M)\n\nIn the Keynesian model, equilibrium is achieved when the value of current production equals planned aggregate expenditures. At that point, there is no incentive for firms to alter their production plans. If expenditures exceed the value of output, business inventories will be drawn down. Firms will need to expand production in order to replenish inventories and meet the higher level of demand. If demand exceeds production, business inventories will rise and production will be cut back until inventories are at normal levels.\n\nNote that equilibrium can occur at levels of output which are below the level of output consistent with full employment.\n\nFigure 4.3: Aggregate Expenditures\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the graph above, AE0 represents aggregate expenditures that would occur at different price levels. The 45 degree line, AE=GDP, represents the points where equilibrium occurs. Equilibrium occurs at point (P0,Q0), where output is less than can be achieved at QF, the output associated with full employment.\n\nIdeally, planned aggregate expenditures will shift to a line such as AE1. At that point, full employment is achieved.\n\nFrom a Keynesian view, market economies are viewed as being inherently unstable: they are prone to booms and busts. Changes in demand, magnified by multiplier effects, tend to cause wild swings in the economy. Fluctuations in private business investment are the largest cause of the economy swinging to different levels of output.\n\nMonetarists believe that fluctuations in the money supply are the chief source of fluctuations in real economic output and that the major cause of inflation is excessive growth in the money supply.\n\r\nAccording to the monetarist view, economies will usually operate at full employment. Aggregate demand is mainly influenced by changes in the money supply. Fluctuations in aggregate demand will be diminished if growth in the money supply is kept at a steady rate. Monetarists concur with the Keynesian viewpoint that wages are \"sticky\" when downward pressures exist.\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_93", "text": "\n\nI. Basics\n\nMoney is a part of everyone's life, and we all want it, but do you know how it gains value and how it is created? Check out the following link for more:\n\r\nThe following page will prime you for the topics discussed in this chapter:\nWhat Is Money?\n\nWhat Are the Functions of Money?\nMoney has three basic functions.\n\n\nIt acts a medium of exchange. If money did not exist, we would have much more complicated lives. If you wished buy bananas, you would need a barter arrangement where another party valued something you had and could also provide you with bananas. Anything can serve as money (ie. Coins, cigarettes, shells) as long as someone else will accept it as a medium of exchange. \n\n\n\nMoney is a way to store value. Although many things (land, gold, etc.) can serve as a store of value, money has one large advantage in the sense that it can quickly be converted into other goods. One problem with using money as a way to store value is that some forms of money do not pay interest. Another problem is that inflation destroys the value of money over time.\n\n\n\nMoney is also used as a unit of account. The values and costs of goods, services, and assets can be expressed as a unit of money. Prices expressed as money are used to help consumers make choices among numerous goods and services.\n\nWhat is the Money Supply?\nThe supply of money is the amount of money available in a country; it is measured in many ways. The two most frequent ways to measure money are referred to as M1 and M2.\n\nM1 is the narrowest definition of the money supply. It includes:\n\n\ncash (currency) in circulation\n\nchecking accounts (demand deposits) - both non-interest earning and interest-earning\n\ntravelers' checks\n\nM2 includes:\n\n\nall components of M1\n\nmoney market mutual funds\n\ndeposits in savings accounts\n\ntime deposit of less than 100K at depository institutions (banks, credit unions, savings and loans)\n\nUsing Commodities as Money\nProblems that arise when using commodities include requiring a double coincidence of wants (does the person you want food from want your cigarettes?) and the difficulties in making price comparisons.\n\n\n\n\n\nLook Out!\r\n\t\t\t\tWithin the context of our discussion, \"Money\" means anything that can be used in exchange for goods or services. It is not referring to currency (in the form of coins, dollar bills, debit cards, etc.) that modern societies use every day to purchase goods and services.\n\n\n\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_94", "text": "\n\nTypes of Institutions\nThere are three major types of depository institutions:\n\n1.Commercial banks\n\n2.Thrift institutions such as credit unions, savings and loan associations (S&Ls), and savings banks. Credit unions are cooperative organizations, usually restricted to employees of a particular firm or government entity. The savings banks and S&Ls have historically focused their loan activities to the real estate mortgages.\n\n3.Money market mutual funds offer bank-like features. Shareholders of these funds are allowed to write checks against these funds. However, these funds do have restrictions. The mutual funds specify minimum check amounts such as $250.\n\nTheir main economic functions include providing liquidity, lowering the cost of borrowing money, and pooling the risk associated with lending money.\n\nAll of these institutions make money by charging more for loans than what they pay for deposits, and they are all subject to substantial regulation.  Major areas of concern for regulation include reserve requirements, capital requirements, lending rules, and deposit rules. For example, in the past, only commercial banks could offer checking accounts, and savings banks could only offer saving accounts. Those restrictions were relaxed in the 1980s.\n\nMoney market mutual funds have been a major force in providing competitive interest rates to short-term depositors. Technological innovation has been a major force in providing new services to customers. For example, crediting interest on a daily basis was not feasible before the advent of modern computer technology.\n\nThe Fractional Reserve Banking System\nA fractional reserve banking system exists when the amount of reserves banks must keep on hand is less than the amount of their deposits. In the U.S., banks must keep a fraction of their assets as bank reserves - cash plus deposits with the Federal Reserve, which is the nation's central bank. Banks issue loans with the funds that are not held in reserve; in doing so, they expand the nation's money supply.\n\nThe Required Reserve Ratio\nThe required reserve ratio is the percentage of a particular liability category (to the bank), such as savings accounts, that must be held as reserves. If someone deposits $10,000 at a bank and there is a 20% reserve requirement, the bank must keep $2,000 as reserves and can loan out only $8,000. If the reserve requirement is 10%, the bank could loan out $9,000. The $9,000 that is loaned out can be deposited at the original bank or at another bank; 90% of that $9,000, which is $8,100, can then be loaned out. This process continues until the amount of money supply generated is equal to $10,000 \u00d7 (1 / .1) = $100,000.\n\nThe Actual and Potential Deposit Expansion Multipliers\nThe potential deposit expansion multiplier is the reciprocal of the required reserve ratio. If the required reserve ratio is 5% (.05), the potential deposit expansion multiplier is equal to 1 / .05 = 20.\n\nThe actual deposit expansion multiplier is less than the potential deposit expansion multiplier for two reasons: \n\n\u00b7Banks may not loan out all available funds (i.e. they may have excess reserves, which are reserves that exceed required reserves)\n\n\u00b7Recipients of loans may not deposit the proceeds; they may instead decide to hold them as currency \n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_95", "text": "\n\nWhat is monetary policy?\nMonetary policy is the control of the money supply (and sometimes credit conditions) to achieve or satisfy macroeconomic goals.\n\nA country's central bank controls the nation's money supply, enacts monetary policy and acts as a clearinghouse between banks. The Federal Reserve is the central bank in the U.S.; in Canada, the central bank is the Bank of Canada.\n\nThe central bank has three tools to control the nation's money supply:\n\n\nSetting of Reserve Requirements - In general, banks will use their reserves to make loans and turn a profit. In doing so, they increase the nation's money supply. Increasing (decreasing) the reserve ratio decreases (increases) the amount of funds available to loan, thereby decreasing (increasing) the nation's money supply. \n\n\nOpen Market Operations - The Federal Reserve can purchase or sell U.S. government securities on the open market. When they purchase (sell) government securities, it increases (decreases) the nation's money supply. The monetary base is equal to bank reserves (vault cash plus reserves held at the Federal Reserve), plus money in circulation. The nation's money supply is a multiple of the monetary base. The Federal Reserve's open market operations directly impact the size of the monetary base.\n\n\nThe Discount Rate - The discount rate is the interest rate charged by the Federal Reserve to banks that borrow money from them. Typically this is done in order to meet temporary shortages of reserves. Note that banks do not automatically have the right to do so. An increase (decrease) in the discount rate will discourage (encourage) banks from letting reserves go to very low levels, thereby tending to decrease (increase) the money supply. \n\nSo if the central bank wishes to pursue an expansionary monetary policy, it will lower reserve requirements, purchase government securities on the open market and/or decrease the discount rate.\n\nA restrictive monetary policy implies that the central bank will increase the reserve requirements, sell government securities and/or increase the discount rate.\n\nProblems Associated with Measuring an Economy's Money Supply\n\u00b7Changes in Checking Accounts - The introduction of interest-earning checking accounts and money market mutual funds (some with check-writing privileges) have made M1 money supply figures for the 1980s and later not comparable to figures for private years\n\n\u00b7Debit Cards - Debit cards transfer funds from the cardholder's checking account when used for purchases and may induce some people to hold less cash.\n\n\u00b7Holding of the U.S. dollar Outside of the U.S. - The amount of currency held by people outside of the U.S. has greatly increased. These holdings are difficult to measure. The impact is greater on M1 than M2 because currency accounts for a relatively smaller portion of M2.\n\n\u00b7 Greater Availability of No-load Mutual (Stock and Bond) Funds - It is now easier for investors to purchase mutual funds without paying an up-front commission (load). These holdings are not counted in M1 or M2. Many mutual funds companies let investors cash out or move their stock and/or bond holdings to a money market account over phone or on the internet.\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_96", "text": "\n\nI. The Supply and Demand of Money\nPeople hold money:\n\n\nTo conduct transactions\n\nFor precautionary reasons, such as to meet emergencies, such as unexpected medical bills\n\nAs a store of value\n\nHolding money has an opportunity cost in the sense that the money could be invested elsewhere and earn interest. Even if the money is held in an interest-earning checking account, a higher rate of interest could be earned by purchasing financial instruments such as bonds.\n\nAs the rate of interest goes higher, the opportunity cost of money increases. So as interest rates go up (down), people will be less (more) willing to hold money.\n\nThe supply of money is usually determined by the Central Bank (Canada) or the Federal Reserve (U.S.) and the targeted supply of money is not directly related to the interest rate.\n\nA graph for the supply and demand for money, as a function of the interest rate, would appear similar to figure 4.4 on the following page.\n\nFigure 4.4: The Supply and Demand for Money\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that this demand curve assumes other relevant factors are held constant. If the quantity of goods produced increases and/or the price level increases, the demand for money will increase. This causes the demand curve to shift to the right. If economic activity declines and/or prices go down, then demand for money will decrease.\n\nChanges in the availability of financial instruments are also changing the demand for money over time. The widespread availability of credit cards has reduced the amount of money that households need to keep on hand.\n\nDetermining Interest Rates\nInterest rates are determined by the interaction of the quantity supplied and the quantity demanded of money. The quantity supplied of money is determined by the actions of the central bank and the banking system. Suppose that the interest rate is too high in the sense that the quantity of money supplied is greater than the quantity of money demanded. People will respond by purchasing bonds, in which case money will be reduced. The greater demand for bonds will push interest rates down, towards equilibrium.\n\nShort and Long-run Effects of Money on Real GDP\n\u00b7Short-Run, Anticipated - If individuals correctly anticipate inflation, in the short-run an expansionary (restrictive) monetary policy will increase (decrease) prices. Real output and employment will remain the same. Nominal interest rates will increase while real interest rates will stay the same.\n\n\u00b7Long-Run, Anticipated - Expansionary (restrictive) monetary policy will increase (decrease) the rate of inflation and increase (decrease) nominal interest rates. Real interest rates, employment levels and real output are not affected by monetary policy.\n\n\u00b7Short-Run, Unanticipated - Unanticipated expansionary monetary policy, assuming the economy is not at full employment, will somewhat increase prices, increase real output and reduce real interest rates. Unanticipated restrictive monetary policy will increase real interest rates, decrease the inflation rate, reduce employment and reduce output. This type of policy is appropriate when the economy is operating at greater than full employment.\n\n\u00b7Long-Run, Unanticipated - Expansionary monetary policy will lead to higher inflation and nominal interest rates while real interest rates, real output and real employment will not be positively impacted. An important point to remember is that, in the long run, inflation is the primary effect of expansionary monetary policy.\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_97", "text": "\nThe Quantity Theory of Money\nThe quantity theory of money proposes that the quantity of money and price levels increase at the same rate in the long run. This concept is demonstrated by the equation of exchange.\n\nThe Equation of Exchange\nThe equation of exchange is comprised of the money stock, M, multiplied by the velocity of money, V. The velocity of money is the number of times money turns over (spent as part of a final good or service) during the year.\n\nTherefore, we get the expression:\n\nFormula 4.4\n\nM \u00d7 V= P \u00d7 Q = Total Spending or GDP\n\nP represents the price level, and Q represents the quantity of goods and services produced. This equation is referred to as the equation of exchange. It is the basic equation used by monetarists - economists who believe that fluctuations in the money supply are the chief source of fluctuations in real economic output and that the major cause of inflation is excessive growth in the money supply.\n\nIf quantity and velocity are basically constants, increasing the money supply will just lead to an increase in prices (inflation). The Quantity Theory of Money holds that in the long run, because quantity and velocity are not changed by the money supply, a percentage increase in the money supply will lead to a corresponding increase in the price level. However, if monetary policy can influence velocity or quantity, monetary policy can be useful.\n\nThe equation of exchange can be converted into the demand for money function:\n\nFormula 4.5\n\nMd = (P \u00d7 Q) / V = Y / V\n\nWhere Md is the demand for money and Y is nominal GDP. From the monetarist's viewpoint, the demand for money is related to nominal GDP, not interest rates (the Keynesian viewpoint). \n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_98", "text": "\n\nDetermining Inflation \n\nInflation vs. Price-Level\nThe term price-level refers to the prices that must be paid in order to acquire a basket of good and services. The phenomenon of inflation refers to a continual rise of the price-level. When inflation occurs, the purchasing power of a unit of money (the dollar in the United States) is declining.\n\nThe inflation rate is calculated by comparing the price level in one time period to the price level of a previous period. Suppose the price level is currently 110, and the price level of the previous year is 100. The annual rate of inflation would then be 10%.\n\nThe inflation rate in general can be stated as:\n\nFormula 4.6\n\nInflation Rate = ((P1 - P0) / P0) X 100\n\nP1 is the price level of the later time period, and P0 is the price level of the previous time period.\n\nCauses of Inflation\n\nTwo main types of impulses for inflation in an economy include:\n\u00b7Demand-pull - aggregate demand rising more rapidly than aggregate supply\n\n\u00b7Cost-push - there is a decrease in aggregate supply\n\nFactors creating a demand-pull inflation include an:\n\n\u00b7Increase in government spending\n\n\u00b7Increase in the supply of money\n\n\u00b7Increase in the price level in the rest of the world - if prices increase in other countries, residents of those countries will want to buy goods from domestic producers; i.e., exports will increase\n\nThe main factors which induce a cost-pull inflation include an:\n\n\u00b7Increase in wage rates\n\n\u00b7Increase in raw material costs\n\nDemand-pull inflation represents an increase in aggregate demand, which will shift the aggregate demand curve to the right. Cost-push inflation will involve the aggregate supply curve shifting to the left.Both result in higher price levels.\n\nUnanticipated Inflation\nUnanticipated inflation in the labor market will cause workers to work for less wages then what they would knowingly work for. Employers may get higher profits due to the higher prices. The result will be a transfer of income from workers to employers. There is also a possibility that employment will be higher than \"full employment\".\n\nUnanticipated inflation in the financial capital market also begets a transfer of income. In this case, borrowers gain at the expense of lenders. The amount of borrowing and lending will not be optimal, as lenders will unwittingly loan out too much funds.\n\nAnticipated vs. Unanticipated Inflation\nInflation that comes as a surprise to most people is called unanticipated inflation. If changes in price levels are widely anticipated, then that inflation is referred to as anticipated inflation. In general, steady rates of inflation can be anticipated successfully by economic decision makers.\n\nThere are many harmful consequences to inflation. Some of the consequences include:\n\n\nIndividuals Apply their Efforts to Protecting Themselves from Inflation Instead of to Production - People will spend a great deal of time and money acquiring information about how to protect themselves (and/or profit) from inflation. Capital flows towards speculative assets such as gold and art objects, instead of productive investments such as buildings and machinery and the incentive to speculate instead of work increases.\n\n\nInflation Increases the Risk of Investments - Wild fluctuations in price levels make forecasting future earnings more difficult; this tend to discourage investment. \n\n\nThe Information Delivered by Prices is Distorted by Inflation - Some price changes are restrained by long-term contracts, while others respond quickly to changes in the general price level. \n\n\nUnanticipated inflation can change relative prices. These distorted prices may provide poor signals to producers and resource suppliers. \n\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_99", "text": "\nTradeoffs Between Unemployment and Inflation (the Phillips Curve)\nThe Phillips curve depicts an inverse relationship between inflation and the rate of unemployment. In other words, higher rates of inflation imply lower rates of unemployment. The relationship is named after the British economist A.W. Phillips, who wrote an influential article about it.\n\nThat inverse relationship held true during the 1960s. During the 1970s, however, the U.S. economy experienced \"stagflation\" - high unemployment and high inflation.\n\nUnexpected rises in the inflation rate decrease the \"real\" wages of workers operating under long-term employment contracts. This stimulates employment as real-wage costs to employers are reduced. Underestimates of inflation induce job seekers to take job offers they may not otherwise take. The job offer given may seem very good (if inflation is not taken into account) and it will be quickly taken. A worker who understands that inflation is eroding his or her real wages would not be so quick to take the job offer.\n\nOnce works begins to anticipate inflation, there is no long-term reduction in the unemployment rate. In the short-term, if inflation is higher than expected, there will temporarily be a reduction in unemployment. If inflation is lower than expected, unemployment will be higher than normal.\n\nFigure 4.5: Modern Phillips Curve with Expectations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the graph above, Un is the natural rate of unemployment.\n\nWhen integrating expectations and the Phillips curve, we find that:\n\n\nExpansionary fiscal and monetary policy leads to inflation, without a permanent reduction in unemployment below the natural rate.\n\nIf inflation is greater (less) than anticipated, unemployment will be below (above) the natural unemployment rate\n\nIf the inflation rate remains the same (does not increase or decrease), then the actual rate of unemployment will move towards the natural rate of unemployment.\n\n\nThe following lessons were learned from the work with Phillips curves:\n\n\nExpansionary macro policy does not reduce the rate of unemployment, at least in the long run. \n\nStable prices help keep unemployment low - stable prices are low unemployment are not conflicting goals. \n\nImpacts of Inflation on the Nominal Interest Rate\nThe nominal interest rate of a bond or loan is simply the stated or named interest rate. The real interest rate is the nominal interest less current or expected inflation.\n\nIf economic participants expect higher inflation, they will alter their economic behavior. Lenders will be less willing to make loans or will demand higher nominal rates of interest in order to compensate for the perceived risk of inflation. Borrowers will seek more loanable funds in anticipation of higher prices. The net result will be higher nominal interest rates.\n\nIncreases in the money supply will lead to higher price levels, unless there is a corresponding increase in real output. Lenders will demand higher nominal interest rates so as to compensate for the expected inflation.  \n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_100", "text": "\n\nBasics\n\nWhat is fiscal policy?\nFiscal policy is the use of government taxation, spending and borrowing to satisfy macroeconomic goals.\n\nPotential GDP\nThe GDP that results from an economy operating at full employment with full utilization of capital is called potential GDP.\n\nA reduction in after-tax wages will occur with the enactment of an income tax. The supply curve of labor will therefore shift up and to the left. The new equilibrium quantity of labor hired will be less than what would have occurred with potential GDP. There will be a \"wedge\" between before-tax and after-tax wage rates. Taxes on expenditure increase the size of the \"wedge\" and further reduce employment.\n\nKeynesians argue that if output is less than what would occur at full employment, fiscal policy should be used to stimulate aggregate demand.\n\nThere are three major ways in which fiscal policy affects aggregate demand:\n\n1.Business Tax Policy - Business taxes can change the profitability of businesses and the amount of business investment. Lowering business taxes will increase aggregate demand and business investment spending. \n\n2.Government Spending - Government can directly increase aggregate demand by increasing its spending. \n\n3.Tax Policy for Individuals - Lowering taxes will increase disposable personal income and increase consumption spending.\n\nFrom the Keynesian viewpoint, fiscal policy should be used to increase aggregate demand when an economy is operating at below full-employment levels. Ideally, the economy will be guided to output at the level of full employment.\n\nIf aggregate demand exceeds aggregate supply and output is at full-employment levels, fiscal policy should be used to reduce aggregate demand. This will push the economy to a point of noninflationary equilibrium.\n\r\nThe Supply Side Model is an economic theory holding that bolstering an economy's ability to supply more goods is the most effective way to stimulate economic growth. Supply-side theorists advocate income tax reduction because it increases private investment in corporations, facilities, and equipment.\n\nThe Laffer curve shows the relationship between tax rates and tax revenue.\n\nFigure 4.6: The Laffer Curve\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis graph shows that as the tax rate increases from zero, the amount of tax revenue collected will increase. At point T*, however, increases in the tax rate lead to decreases in the tax revenue collected. High tax rates also produce a loss to society in the sense that productive economic activity is being discouraged.\n\nGovernments would like to be at point T*, because it is the point at which the government collects maximum amount of tax revenue while people continue to work hard. This would theoretically be the point at which potential GDP is maximized.\n\nSupply-side economists believe that high marginal tax rates, such as those experienced in the U.S. in the 1970s, diminished aggregate production without raising substantial amounts of additional tax revenue. Tax cuts during the 1980s (the Reagan presidency) are believed to have induced strong increases in supply, particularly with regards to high-income earners. Supporters of the 2001 U.S. tax cuts, which reduced the top marginal tax rates, believe that the cuts have increased economic growth through better supply-side incentives.\n\nTax policy also has consequences at a global level. Ireland has significantly reduced its personal and corporate tax rates; during the 1990s its growth rate was much higher than the rest of Europe. There is an association with high European tax rates and slow rates of economic growth. \n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_101", "text": "\nInvestment sources include: \n\u00b7Private saving \n\u00b7Government saving\n\u00b7Borrowing from foreigners\n\nCapital markets are influenced by fiscal policy in two ways:\n\n\u00b7Government spending and tax policy will generate either a budget surplus or a deficit, which will in turn mean that the government sector will either contribute towards financing investment or \"crowd out\" private investment.\n\u00b7Tax policy will affect the amount saved. Taxes on interest earned will decrease the incentive to save and create a wedge between the after-tax interest earned by savers and the interest rate paid by firms.\n\nGenerational Effects of Fiscal Policy\nCurrent fiscal policy impacts the amount of taxes that future citizens will pay. If the government runs up long-term budget deficits, then future generations will need to pay higher taxes in order to pay the interest. Similarly, future generations will pay lower taxes if the government creates budget surpluses. Economists have created systems which examine the lifetime taxes and benefits associated with generations or age groups. Those systems are referred to as generational accounting.\n\nA government that chronically runs deficits will, at some point in time, have to address that imbalance. This fiscal imbalance will need to be addressed with higher tax revenues and/or reduced government spending.An imbalance is also created when the government benefits received by one generation exceed the taxes paid by that generation. For example, initial recipients of Social Security in the United States received far more benefits than they paid in taxes. Such imbalances are referred to as generational imbalances.Future generations will need to pay more taxes, or receive less benefits, in order to address this imbalance. Fiscal policy therefore transfers benefits according to age; it also determines how much each generation will pay the government. \n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_102", "text": "\nThe marginal propensity to consume (MPC) is equal to \u0394C / \u0394Y, where \u0394C is change in consumption, and \u0394Y is change in income. If consumption increases by eighty cents for each additional dollar of income, then MPC is equal to 0.8 / 1 = 0.8.\n\nThe expenditure multiplier is the ratio of the change in total output induced by an autonomous expenditure change.\n\n\n\n\n\nLook Out!\r\n\t\t\t\tIn the Keynesian model, government and private investment spending are considered to be autonomous while consumption is not because it is a function of income.\n\n\n\n\nSome consumption is considered to be autonomous. Even with no income, some consumption will occur (savings will need to be used). So the consumption function could be expressed as C = \u03b1 + (\u03b2 \u00d7 Y), where \u03b1 represents consumption that occurs regardless of income, \u03b2 is the marginal propensity to consume and Y is income.\n\nWhy is there a multiplier effect?\nSuppose a large corporation decides to build a factory in a small town and that spending on the factory for the first year is $5 million. That $5 million will go to electricians, engineers and other various people building the factory. If MPC is equal to 0.8, those people will spend $4 million on various goods and services. The various business and individual receiving that $4 million will in turn spend $3.2 million and so on.\n\nIf the marginal propensity to consume is equal to 0.8 (4 / 5), then the multiplier can be calculated as:\n\nMultiplier = 1 / (1 - MPC) = 1 / (1 - 0.8) = 1 / 0.2 = 5\n\nAs a result of the multiplier effect, small changes in investment or government spending can create much larger changes in total output. A positive aspect of the multiplier effect is that macroeconomic policy can effect substantial improvements with relatively small amounts of autonomous expenditures. A negative aspect is that a small decline in business investment can trigger a larger decline in business activity and, thereby, create instability.\n\nThe previously mentioned formula for calculating the multiplier is a simplified one. Leakages (money spent, but not on domestic goods or domestic services) reduce the size of the multiplier. Examples of leakages include taxes and imports.\n\nAnother important point is that the multiplier effect takes time to work; months must pass before even half of the total multiplier effect is felt. Also, keep in mind that the multiplier effect can cause idle resources to be moved into production. If unemployment is widespread, then there should be little impact on resource prices. \n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_103", "text": "\nDiscretionary Fiscal Policy\nDiscretionary fiscal policy is made more difficult due to lags in recognizing the need for changed fiscal policy and the lags that occur with enacting the changed fiscal policy. Implementing the modified fiscal policy usually requires legislative action, which takes a long time to implement. There is a concern that fiscal policy changes may be ill-timed, however. For example, an expansionary fiscal policy may be enacted when the economy is already recovering from a recession. Fiscal policy does have an advantage over monetary policy in the sense that increased government spending leads to an immediate increase in aggregate demand. The effects of a tax cut may be more moderate and have more of a time lag because individuals may not immediately spend their increases in disposable income that resulted from the tax cut.\n\nIdeally, fiscal policy will be used to increase aggregate demand during recessions and to restrain aggregate demand during boom times. Poorly timed fiscal policy could actually increase inflation and accelerate declines in the economy when the economy has already started to slow down.\n\nOne difficulty with proper timing is that forecasting economic activity is not an exact science. There is usually a lag between the time fiscal policy changes are needed and the instance that the need to act is widely recognized. There can also be a substantial amount of time between the time of recognition and the time that fiscal policy changes are actually enacted. Lastly, another difficulty with achieving proper timing is that the impact of a change in fiscal policy may not be felt until six to twelve months after the change has occurred.\n\nAutomatic Stabilizers\r\nAutomatic stabilizers, without specific new legislation, increase (decrease) budget deficits during times of recessions (booms). They enact countercyclical policy without the lags associated with legislative policy changes. Examples include:\n\n\u00b7Corporate Profits - Taxes on corporate profits go up substantially during boom times, and decline rapidly during times of recession.\n\n\u00b7Progressive Income Taxes - Progressive taxation push people into higher income tax brackets during boom times, substantially increasing their tax bill and reducing government budget deficits (or increasing government surpluses). During recessions, many individuals fall into lower tax brackets or have no income tax liability. This increases the size of the government budget deficit (or reduces the surplus).\n\n\u00b7 The Unemployment Insurance (UI) Program - This program provides payments to greater numbers of people as unemployment increases during times of recession. At the same time, the taxes that contribute to UI will go down as employment decreases. These two effects will cause the government budget deficit to increase. During boom times, the program will automatically produce surpluses (or reduce deficits) as fewer benefits are paid due to lower unemployment and tax revenues increase due to greater employment.\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_104", "text": "\n\nStable Prices vs. Sustainable Growth in real GDP\nPrice level stability refers to the concept that price levels are stable enough so that people do not feel compelled to take inflation into account when making economic decisions. Many economists believe that measured inflation in the range of 0 up to 2 or 3 percent a year is actually zero inflation. There may be quality improvements in goods that are not reflected in the official measurement of inflation; this reflects a price level measurement bias.\n\nPrice level stability is only a means to a higher goal. That goal is a rising standard of living, which depends upon sustainable growth in real GDP. Whether or not that growth is sustainable depends upon other factors such as technological advances, availability of natural resources, the willingness of people to work, the willingness of people to invest, and political stability. Monetary policy helps to create a stable environment which favors investment and saving.\n\nAchieving Price Level Stability\nThe Federal Reserve can quickly affect short-term interest rates, such as three-month T-bills and rates on savings deposits. However, the impact of monetary policy on longer-term interest rates is more moderate and more difficult to predict. Longer-term interest rates are more influenced by the supply and demand for investment funds, as opposed to monetary factors. Secondly, the impact of inflation must be taken into account. For example, suppose an expansionary monetary policy is perceived to be inflationary. The impact of that policy on longer-term interest rates, such as real estate mortgages, will be to raise them.\n\nExpansionary Monetary Policy\nAn expansionary monetary policy, if inflationary effects are not anticipated, should lower interest rates, particularly short-term ones. It will also have the effect of reducing velocity, as the opportunity cost of holding money is reduced. Eventually the lower interest rates will induce more personal and business spending to occur so that aggregate demand will increase. This process could take several quarters. Eventually the increased demand will cause nominal and real interest rates to go higher, which will increase the velocity of money. At that point the impact of the expansionary monetary policy will be further amplified. \n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_105", "text": "\n\nExpectations impact perceptions about inflation and the timing of those perceptions. The effectiveness of expansionary monetary and fiscal policy with regards to increases in output and employment is reduced by expectations. The reduction in output caused by restrictive monetary and fiscal policy will be moderated by expectations, as economic participants will more quickly anticipate the lowering of overall price levels.\n\nDemand curves for labor and capital slope downward to the right. With other factors held constant, employers will only hire more workers if real wage rates have decreased and capital expenditures will increase only if real interest rates have declined.\n\nExpansionary monetary and fiscal policy often assumes that workers will accept lower real wages and that investors will accept lower real rates of return. It is the willingness of workers to accept wages that are lower than what they would normally demand, and the willingness of investors to accept lower real interest rates than normal that causes employment and real production to increase. Nominal wages and interest rates remain the same; inflation is doing the job of cutting real wages and interest rates. Therefore, in order for employment and production to increase, inflation must increase so that real wages and interest rates can go down. This relationship is described by the original Phillips curve, which shows that inflation accompanies lower rates of unemployment.\n\nAs long as the public does not understand that inflation has increased, the economy can be moved according to the Phillips curve relationship.\n\nWhy would it take time for the public to recognize and adapt to the new rate of inflation? \nOne reason is that some workers may not be able to do anything about it. They may be locked into multi-year labor agreements that do not permit negotiation until the expiration of the labor agreement. Investors and employees might also be subject to money illusion - their attention could be focused on their nominal wages and nominal interest rates, and they may not realize that real wages and interest rates are declining. At some point in time, however, they will recognize that their real buying power (from wages and interest income) has gone down.\n\nAlso, they may not immediately see that inflation is occurring. Not all prices go up during times of inflation, so it may hard to see the big picture.\n\nEventually, the public will understand and adapt to the new inflationary environment and they will seek raises in wages and interest rates in order to bring them back to their old income levels. The economy will move to a long-term equilibrium position in which output and employment return to points where they were before the monetary and fiscal stimulus occurred. The major change will be that prices will be at a higher level.\n\nThis makes sense, as we should not expect major benefits to occur just from printing more paper money or running larger government deficits!\n\nExpectations essentially reduce the time that government policymakers can fool the public into accepting cuts in real wage and real interest rates and, therefore, the positive effects of financial and monetary stimulus are moderated.\n\nNew Monetarist vs New Keynesian Feedback Rules\nThere are two famous new feedback rules for monetary policy. Those rules are:\n\n\nThe Taylor rule is a Keynesian feedback rule that focuses on short-term interest rates. The rule takes into account the target inflation rate, the difference between actual inflation and the target inflation rate, and the difference between real GDP and potential GDP.\n\n\nThe McCallum rule is a monetarist rule that emphasizes the growth rate of money. It states that the Federal Reserve should target a monetary base growth rate equal to the target inflation rate plus the ten-year moving average of the real GDP growth rate minus the four-year moving average of the monetary base velocity.\n\nThe major differences between the rules are:\n\n\u00b7Targeting an interest rate versus monetary growth (as usual for Keynesians versus monetarists!).\n\u00b7The Taylor rule provides for a response to fluctuations in real GDP, while the McCallum rule does not. \n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_106", "text": "\nNow that we have discussed everything you need to know regarding micro and macroeconomics, let's broaden the scope to also include international trade, foreign exchange and the balance of payments.\n\nUnderstanding how one country's economy and government reacts with other countries' economic activity is important because it helps analysts to determine the strength of economies around the world, as well as exchange rate movement.\n\nTRADING WITH THE WORLD\nA nation can gain from international trade when:\n\n\nIts relative costs of producing various goods differ from other nations\n\nIt specializes in producing goods in which the nation is relatively efficient at producing and uses the proceeds from its output to produce goods for which it is relatively inefficient.\n\nNote that these costs are relative to a country's opportunity costs.

Consumers benefit by being able to purchase the lower-priced goods. Manufacturers often benefit by being able to purchase parts at lower costs. \n\nBetter Institutions and Government Policies - Global trade gives government policymakers incentive to create constructive economic policy.

To simplify things, we will assume that only two goods are produced - wheat and steel.\n\nFigure 5.1: Production Possibility Curves\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the production possibilities curve shown in the above graphs, the U.S. could produce 50 units of wheat per worker, if it devoted all of its resources to wheat production, and zero units of steel. If all resources were devoted to producing steel, then the U.S. would have 50 units of steel per worker and no wheat. If Great Britain devotes all of its resources to making wheat, it can produce 20 units of wheat, with no steel being produced. If that country concentrates all of its resources on producing steel, then 40 units of steel would be produced per worker, with no wheat production. Please note that the U.S. has an absolute advantage over Great Britain with both products because the U.S. workers are more productive than those from Great Britain. However, this is not important from an international trade perspective.\n\nThe domestic exchange rate within the U.S. for the two goods is 1:1; for each unit of steel produced, the U.S. must give up producing one unit of wheat. We could say that the cost of one unit of steel within the U.S., assuming no international trade, would be one unit of wheat. Similarly, the cost of one unit of wheat would be the loss of one unit of steel.\n\nGreat Britain would have a different domestic exchange rate. Its production possibility curve implies that the cost of one unit of steel would be one-half of a unit of wheat. The cost of one unit of wheat would be two units of steel. These costs can be obtained by looking at the slope of the production possibility curve.\n\nIf the U.S. and Great Britain both operated as autarkies (self-sufficient nations that do not trade), then each country would operate somewhere on their production possibilities curve. The exact point of production would depend on each country's supply and demand for the goods. For example, these points could be 35 units of wheat and 15 units of steel for the U.S., and 10 units of wheat and 20 units of steel for Great Britain, as illustrated in Figure 5.1.\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_108", "text": "\nA general rule of efficiency is that an individual or group should specialize in production activities in which it can operate more efficiently than other entities. This principle is referred to as comparative advantage when discussing international trade theory; it states that the worldwide production output is maximized when each country concentrates on producing goods for which it has lower opportunity costs.\n\nIn Figure 5.1, the U.S. is the low-cost producer for wheat, as it only gives up one unit of steel when it produces one unit of wheat. Great Britain is the high-cost producer for wheat, as it must give up two units of steel for each unit of wheat produced. However, Great Britain is the low cost producer for steel, as it gives up only one-half of a unit of wheat for each unit of steel produced. Therefore, the U.S. has a comparative advantage in producing wheat, while Great Britain has a comparative advantage in producing steel. According to the trade efficiency rule, the world will be better off if Great Britain specializes in steel production and the U.S. specializes in wheat production.\n\nAn easy way to determine which country has the comparative advantage is to compare the slopes of the production possibility curves. Suppose you have production possibility curves for two countries with product Y and X, and product Y is placed on the y-axis. The country with the most negative slope for product Y will have the comparative advantage with product Y.\n\nSuppose each country specialized in producing the good for which it had a comparative advantage. The U.S. would produce 50 units of wheat per worker and Great Britain would produce 40 units of steel per worker. The combined world output would be 50 units of wheat and 40 units of steel. With no trade, the combined wheat output is 45 units and the combined steel output is 35 units. Clearly the two countries can benefit from trading with one another - the quantity of wheat produced goes up by five units and the quantity of steel produced goes up by five units. Trading offers more efficient production possibilities.\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_109", "text": "\nThe next question to determine is what the terms of trade would be. Clearly the U.S. will not accept less than one unit of steel per unit of wheat, as that is the cost if no trade occurs. Also, we know that Great Britain will not accept less than one-half of a unit of wheat for its steel, as that is the cost tradeoff without trade.\n\nThe actual terms of trade would need to lie somewhere in between these limits. Suppose Great Britain offered five units of wheat for each five units of U.S. steel. The U.S. would not accept such an offer for its steel production because five units of steel could be traded for five units of wheat internally.\n\nThe actual terms of trade will depend on overall world and supply conditions, within the limits just mentioned. However, trade will not occur unless the trade is mutually beneficial.\n\nSuppose the terms of trade settle at 1.5 units of steel per unit of wheat. We can graph a trading possibilities curve and relate that curve to the original production possibilities curve.\n\nFigure 5.2: Trading Possibilities Curve\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe slope of the trading possibilities curve will be -1.5 for each country. The original production possibilities curve is shifted to the trading possibilities curve by specializing in the production of the good for which each country has a comparative advantage and by then engaging in international trade. As the possible amount of consumption increases for both countries, they will each enjoy a higher standard of living.\n\nRecall that we assume that without trade, the U.S. will consume 35 units of wheat and 15 units of steel for the U.S and that Great Britain will consume ten units of wheat and 20 units of steel. These points are shown as Point A in both of the graphs above. With the trading possibilities at -1.5, the U.S. could specialize in wheat production and then trade 12 units of wheat for 18 units of steel. The country would then end up with 18 units of steel, and keep 38 units of its own wheat production. This point is described as Point B in the U.S. graph above. Great Britain could benefit in a similar manner.\n\nNote that the above analysis assumes that relative production costs are constant, which allows for straight lines to be used as a production possibilities curve. In reality, as more and more of a good is produced, relative production costs increase because less efficient resources will be used as production increases. As a result, we expect that production possibility curves will be curved lines. Therefore, specialization will not be an all-or-nothing type of situation. Even if the U.S. is a relatively inefficient producer of steel, some steel production will still occur in the United States. Similarly, while Great Britain will mostly be producing steel, some wheat production will still occur in Great Britain.\n\nDomestic producers of goods that are produced relatively cheaply will be able to get higher prices in the world market. Suppose the U.S. is a relatively efficient producer of wheat. In the Figure 5.3 below, the quantity demanded and the quantity supplied would be equal at domestic price Pdw. However, U.S. wheat producers would prefer to export their goods at the world price Pww. By doing so, they will achieve higher profits. Consumers will lose out because they will have to pay higher world prices.\n\nFigure 5.3: Effects of International Trade on Domestic Supply and Demand\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, for goods produced relatively inefficiently by the U.S., consumers will benefit by paying lower prices. Using shirts as an example, we can see that without international trade, consumers would pay price Pds for shirts. By allowing imports, consumers can pay the lower price Pws. Producers are hurt because they will have to take the lower world price.\n\nFigure 5.4: Effects of International Trade on Domestic Supply and Demand\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_110", "text": "\n\nTariffs\nTariffs are taxes imposed on imported goods; they will increase the price of the good in the domestic market.

They are usually \"voluntarily\" negotiated so that quotas or tariffs are not imposed.\n\nExchange Rate Controls\nExchange rate controls set the exchange rate of a nation's currency above the market rate. This makes the nation's exports artificially expensive, which reduces the quantities of the nation's goods that foreigners are willing to buy. This means that the country's citizens have little foreign currency available to buy imported goods. With exchange rate controls, black markets usually exist where currency exchange occurs at a market rate. Exchange rate controls are declining in popularity, although some developing nations still use them.\n\n\"Hidden\" Methods\nHidden methods of limiting imports include special regulations and licensing requirements that restrict imports. For instance, the Japanese government imposes special quality requirements on food to restrict food imports and protect Japanese farmers. \n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_111", "text": "\n\nAdvantages and Disadvantages\nTrade barriers reduce the possible quantity of goods that can be consumed and produced within an economy. Prices will be higher, and there will be fewer choices with regards to consumer goods.\n\nBeneficiaries of a tariff include the government, which collects the tariff, and domestic producers within the affected industry (or industries). The general public (consumers) loses.\n\nArguments in favor of trade restrictions include: \n\n\nNational Defense - Foreign producers should not be relied upon for production of defense goods, even if the goods can be produced at a lower cost abroad.\n\n\nInfant Industries - Start-up industries in a country may not be able to effectively compete against foreign producers because of their small size. An argument can be made that these industries should be protected until suitable economies of scale can be achieved. If the economies of scale are such that the domestic industry achieves a comparative advantage over foreign companies, the temporary protection will help to achieve better economic efficiency\n\n\nAnti-Dumping - The claim is often made that foreign producers \"dump\" their goods on the domestic market. The term dumping is applied when foreign producers are thought to be selling goods at prices below their production costs, or below the prices charged in their home market. Retaliatory measures may include the imposition of tariffs, quotas or fines against foreign producers. The fear is that this \"unfair\" practice will drive domestic producers out of business and that the foreign producers will then impose monopoly pricing. One argument against this fear is that when prices are raised at a later time, domestic producers can reenter the market. Deliberately driving other producers out by selling at a loss usually does not work. Another argument against \"anti-dumping\" is that the country as a whole benefits when foreign-made goods are sold at lower prices than domestic ones. The reasons for which the prices are lower should not be a primary concern.\n\nNations often adopt trade restrictions due to:\n\n\nShort-Sightedness - In the short-run, the imposition of a tariff may help to preserve jobs in the relevant domestic industry. The effort to avoid unemployment in the affected industry also makes for good politics. However, in the long-run, those workers will find other jobs and the economy will be operating at full employment in a more efficient manner.\n\n\nSpecial Interests - Special interests can use their powers to put trade restrictions in place. Although free trade benefits the general public, it does not necessarily benefit all groups within the economy. Management and workers in an industry impacted by foreign goods will not willingly go through dislocation and adjustments (such as retraining) that may be necessitated by foreign competition\n\n\nEconomic Ignorance - Ignorance also contributes to the creation of trade restrictions. Most members of the general public are not aware of the harm created by trade restrictions.\n\n\nVisibility - The benefits of trade restrictions are large and highly visible for small, select groups of people. The benefits of free trade are dispersed across the general population and are, therefore, harder to see. It is easy to note jobs lost to foreign competition; it is not easy to see that those displaced labor resources will be reallocated to more efficient jobs. \n\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_112", "text": "\n\nLaw of Demand for Foreign Exchange\nThe law of demand for foreign exchange states that, all other factors remaining equal, the quantity demanded of a particular currency will decrease (increase) as the exchange rate goes higher (lower). Demand for a country's currency is derived from the goods or services produced by that country. The purchase of a Japanese car by an American consumer will necessitate the conversion of dollars to Japanese yen. As the exchange rate rises (in terms of Japanese yen), Japanese cars will become more expensive to American consumers, who will in turn buy fewer Japanese cars. The lower demand for Japanese cars will lead to a decreased demand for the yen. If the exchange rate for the yen vs. the dollar goes down, Japanese goods will be cheaper for American consumers. As a result, more Japanese goods will be purchased and more dollars will be exchanged for yen.\n\nLaw of Supply for Foreign Exchange\nThe law of supply for foreign exchange states that, all other factors remaining equal, the supplied quantity of a particular currency will increase (decrease) as the exchange rate goes higher (lower). U.S. citizens supply U.S. dollars to the foreign currency market when they buy foreign goods or services, or when they purchase foreign assets such as real estate or stocks. As the exchange rate increases (e.g. the price of a U.S. dollar in terms of Japanese yen goes from 100 yen per dollar to 110 yen per dollar), more U.S. dollars will be supplied as U.S. citizens get more value for their \"buck\".\n\nFactors Affecting the Quantity of Demand and Supply for Currency\nThere are two main factors that affect the quantities demanded and supplied for a particular currency:\n\n\u00b7Relative interest rates\n\u00b7Expectations concerning future exchange rates\n\nIf, for example, interest rates in the United States are higher than those of other countries, foreigners will want to convert their currencies to dollars in order to earn a higher rate of return. Their actions will cause a reduction in the supply of dollars.\n\nExpectations about future exchange rates will also impact current quantities demanded and supplied for currencies. For example, suppose the current exchange rate for euros and dollars is $1.20 per euro and an importer of European goods expects the euro to depreciate next month to $1.1 per euro. That importer will hold off on converting dollars to euros thereby decreasing the current quantity demanded for euros and the quantity supplied for dollars.\n\nHow is the Exchange Rate Influenced by Supply and Demand\nIf the demand for a currency increases (decreases) while the supply remains the same, the exchange rate will rise (decline) to achieve market equilibrium. If the supply of a currency increases (decreases) while demand remains the same, the exchange rate will decline (rise). Exchange rates can be volatile because supply and demand are affected by common factors, such as interest rate differentials and expectations. \n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_113", "text": "\n\nPurchasing Power Parity\nPurchasing power parity expresses the idea that a bundle of goods in one country should cost the same in another country after exchange rates are taken into account. Suppose that with existing relative prices and exchange rates, a basket of goods can be purchased for fewer U.S. dollars in Canada than in the United States. We would then expect U.S. consumers to buy those goods in Canada. Even if this is not possible from a transportation or cost viewpoint, some businesses will have an incentive to buy the goods cheaply in Canada and remarket them in the United States. Such actions would cause U.S. dollars to be sold in exchange for Canadian dollars. As a result, the U.S. dollar would depreciate in relation to the Canadian dollar. We would expect the currency depreciation to continue until the bundle of goods costs the same in both countries.\n\nInterest Rate Parity\nInterest rate parity has to do with the idea that money should (after adjusting for risk) earn an equal rate of return. Suppose that an investor can earn 6% interest with a dollar deposit in a United States bank, or can earn 4% interest with a British pound deposit in a London bank. The investor can earn greater interest income by keeping funds in dollars and, therefore, one might expect all of his investment funds to flow to U.S. banks. However, exchange rate expectations also come into play. Suppose the investor expects the British pound to appreciate at the rate of 2% in terms of the dollar. That investor would then be indifferent to either investment choice, as both are expected to earn 6%.\n\nWhy Central Banks Intervene in the Market\nSuppose the United States Federal Reserve is interested in the dollar to euro exchange rate. It can directly influence that exchange rate by buying or selling euros with U.S. dollars. If the Fed buys euros with dollars, it will increase the supply of dollars and decrease the supply of euros. This action tends to cause the U.S. dollar to depreciate in relation to the euro.\n\nA central bank will intervene in the foreign exchange market because it wishes to reduce volatility, and/or it has a specific target exchange rate. Suppose the Fed wants the euro and dollar to trade 1:1, with an allowable range of 2% in either direction. If the exchange rate rose to above 1.02 euros per dollar, the Fed would sell dollars; if the exchange rate fell below .98 euros per dollar, it would buy dollars.\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_114", "text": "\n\nDirect and Indirect Methods of Foreign Exchange Quotations\nWith the direct method of foreign exchange quotation, the exchange rate is expressed as the number of units of the domestic currency needed to acquire one (1.0) unit of the pertinent foreign currency.

Foreign currency dealers will quote both a bid and an ask for a particular currency. The average of the bid and ask (ask plus bid divided by two) is referred to as the midpoint price. The bid-ask spread is usually given as a percentage and it is calculated as:\n\nFormula 5.1\n\n% Spread = 100 \u00d7 (Ask Price - Bid Price)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ask Price\n\nExample: Bid-Ask Spread\nSuppose that a dealer provides the following quote in the U.S. for euros to  dollars:\n\nDirect ($/\u00ac): $0.8038/$0.8041\n\nThen the bid-ask spread will be 100 \u00d7 (0.8041 - 0.8038) / 0.8041 =  0.0373%, which is about 4 bps.\n\nFactors Influencing the Size of Spreads\nFactors that affect the size of spreads for spot or forward currency exchange rates include:\n\n\nTrading Volume - The higher the volume, or the more active a market, the lower the bid-ask spread.\n\nCurrency Rate Volatility - With higher volatility, currency dealers are exposed to higher risk. Spreads will increase with higher volatility. \n\nPerceived Economic/Political Risks - Risks such as political instability, higher inflation and changing economic conditions will affect the spreads associated with a particular currency. The higher the uncertainty, the greater the expected spread.\n\nNote that if a dealer has an overly large position in a currency relative to the desired net position, the dealer will alter the midpoint of the spread rather than adjust the spread. For instance, a dealer with a shortage of a particular currency will move the midpoint of the direct quote up. Competition is also an important factor for spreads. A dealer with an overly large spread will not be making trades.\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_116", "text": "\n\nCalculating Currency Cross Rates When Given Two Spot Exchange Quotes Involving Three Currencies\nA currency dealer located in a particular country will usually provide a set of exchange rate quotations between the country's currency and various foreign currencies. The cross-rate between two currencies not explicitly quoted is obtained by getting quotes for each currency in terms of the exchange rate with a third nation's currency. Suppose you are told that the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar per euro is 1.2440 and that the exchange rate for U.S. dollar per British pound is 1.8146. The euro-to-pound cross rate can be calculated as the euro-to-dollar rate multiplied by the dollar-to-pound rate, which is equal to (1/1.2440) \u00d7 1.8146 = 1.4587, or \u00ac1.4587 per British pound. Note that this result is an indirect quote from the viewpoint of a British entity, or a direct quote from the viewpoint of a business whose domestic currency is the euro.\n\nIn general, in calculating cross-rates, bid and ask prices will need to be dealt with.\n\nThis makes the calculation only slightly more difficult. The following equations should be kept in mind:\n\nFormula 5.2\n\r\n(FCa / FCb)ask = (FCa / DC)ask \u00d7(DC/FCb)ask\n\r\n(FCa / FCb)bid  = (FCa / DC)bid \u00d7(DC/FCb)bid\n\nWhere FCa and FCb are the two foreign currencies and DC is the domestic currency.\n\nSimilar equations are used when calculating FCb to FCa exchange rates.\n\nExample: Currency Cross Rates and Ask Quotations\nVerifications can be made by checking that (FCb/FCa)ask is equal to the reciprocal of (FCa/FCb)bid, and by checking that (FCb/FCa)bid is equal to the reciprocal of (FCa/FCb)ask.\n\nSuppose you are given the following bid/ask quotations for two foreign currencies against the domestic currency, the U.S. dollar: \n\nBid  Ask\n\u00ac / $ 0.9002 0.9023\n\u00a5 / $ 109.38 109.40\n\nWe want to calculate what the \u00a5 / \u00ac bid and ask quotations will be.\n\nAnswer:\nThe \u00a5 / \u00ac bid price will be the number of yen the dealer is willing to pay in order to buy one euro. This transaction would be the equivalent of selling yen to purchase dollars (at the bid rate of 109.38), and simultaneously reselling the dollars to purchase euros (at the ask rate of 0.9023). The bid \u00a5 / \u00ac would be calculated as 109.38/0.9023 = 121.22.\n\nThe \u00a5 / \u00ac ask price would be the number of yen the dealer wants to receive in exchange for selling one euro. This transaction would be the equivalent of buying yen with dollars (at the 109.40 ask rate) and at the same time buying those dollars with euros, at the 0.9002 bid rate. The transaction could be expressed mathematically as:\n\nAsk \u00a5 / \u00ac = 109.40 / 0.9002 = 121.53\n\nSo the resulting dealer quotation would be:\n\n\u00a5 / \u00ac = 121.22 - 121.53\n\n\n\n\n\nExam Tip!\nYou can count on getting questions like these on the exam, so make sure that you are comfortable with these types of questions.\n\n\n\n\nSpot vs Forward Markets Within Foreign Exchange\nThere are two types of markets for setting currency exchange rates:\n\n\nThe Spot Currency Exchange Market - This market involves trades of currencies for immediate delivery. Settlement usually occurs two days after the trade date. Participants in this market want to convert to the other currency relatively quickly. Transactions in the spot market are often used for investments, or to settle commercial purchases of goods.\n\n\nThe Forward Currency Exchange Market - This market involves contracts for currency exchange in which settlement will take place more than two days after the trade date. While settlement dates are negotiable, standard foreign currency forward contracts usually settle 30, 90 or 180 days after the trade date. If a dealer quotes the 90-day \u00a5 / $ exchange rate at 109.80-109.83, that means the dealer is willing to commit today to buying dollars for 109.80 yen in 90 days, or to selling dollars at 109.83 yen per dollar 90 days from today. \n\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_117", "text": "\n\nSpreads on Forward Currency Quotations\nThe spread on a forward currency quotation is calculated in the same manner as the spread for a spot currency quotation.\n\nThe reasons that spreads vary with forward foreign currency quotations are similar to the reasons for the variability of spreads with spot foreign currency quotations. The unique factor associated with spreads for forward foreign currency quotations is that spreads will widen as the length of time until settlement increases. Currency exchange rates would be expected to have a higher range of fluctuations over longer periods of time, which increases dealer risk. Also, as time increases, fewer dealers are willing to provide quotes, which will also tend to increase the spread.\n\nCalculating a Forward Discount or Premium, Expressed as an Annualized Rate.\nForward currency exchange rates often differ from the spot exchange rate. If the forward exchange rate for a currency is higher than the spot rate, there is a premium on that currency. A discount exists when the forward exchange rate is lower than the spot rate. A negative premium is equivalent to a discount.\n\nExample: Forward Discount Premium\nIf the ninety day \u00a5 / $ forward exchange rate is 109.50 and the spot rate is \u00a5 / $ = 109.38, then the dollar is considered to be \"strong\" relative to the yen, as the dollar's forward value exceeds the spot value. The dollar has a premium of 0.12 yen per dollar. The yen would trade at a discount because its forward value in terms of dollars is less than its spot rate.\n\nThe annualized rate can be calculated by using the following formula:\n\nFormula 5.3\n\nAnnualized Forward Premium =   Forward Price - Spot Price\u00a0\u00a0x\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 12\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0x\u00a0 100%\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Spot Price   \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 # of months\n\nAnswer:\n\nSo in the case listed above, the premium would be calculated as:\n\nAnnualized forward premium= \n\n((109.50 - 109.38 \u00f7 109.38) \u00d7 (12 \u00f7 3) \u00d7 100% = 0.44%\n\nSimilarly, to calculate the discount for the Japanese yen, we first want to calculate the forward and spot rates for the Japanese yen in terms of dollars per yen. Those numbers would be (1/109.50 = 0.0091324) and (1/109.38 = 0.0091424), respectively.\n\nSo the annualized forward discount for the Japanese yen, in terms of U.S. dollars, would be: \n((0.0091324 - 0.0091424) \u00f7 0.0091424) \u00d7 (12 \u00f7 3) \u00d7 100% = -0.44%\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_118", "text": "\n\nInterest Rate Parity\nInterest rate parity enforces an essential link between spot exchange currency rates, forward currency exchange rates and short-term interest. It specifies a relationship that must exist between the spot interest rates of two different currencies if no arbitrage opportunities are to exist. The relationship depends on the spot and forward exchange rates between the two currencies.\n\nThe following example illustrates what interest rate parity is and why it must exist.\n\nExample:\nAssume the following data for the euro (\u00ac) and the U.S. dollar ($):\n\nOne-year forward exchange rate  \u00ac/$ = 0.909\n\nSpot exchange rate  \u00ac/$ = 0.901\n\nOne-year interest rate, euro   7%\n\nOne-year interest rate, dollar   5%\n\nA speculator could borrow dollars at 5%, convert them into euros and invest  the euros at 7%. The speculator would be making a profit of 2%.\n\nHowever, at the end of the time period, euros will need to be converted to dollars so that the initial borrowing can be repaid. The speculator runs the risk that dollars may have depreciated relative to the euro during that time period.\n\nThe speculator's position can potentially be made into a risk-free one by purchasing a forward exchange contract so that the exchange rate used to convert euros back to dollars is a known one.\n\nOver one year, the speculator would experience the following exchange rate loss:(0.901 - 0.909) \u00f7 0.901 = -0.9%\n\nBecause of the 2% interest rate differential, the speculator makes a net profit of 1.1% for each dollar borrowed. This is a certain gain, as all exchange and interest rates were fixed and known at the beginning of the trade, and no capital had to be invested in the position either!\n\nIf such rates existed in the real world, enormous swaps of capital would be made to take advantage of such a risk-free arbitrage. To prevent this from occurring, the forward discount rate would have to equal the difference in interest rates. Note that if the discount forward rate is greater than the interest rate differential, the arbitrage will be made in the other direction.\n\nThe actual mathematical relationship is slightly more complicated than what was specified above because a perfect arbitrage would require that the forward contract cover both the initial principal borrowed plus the accrued interest. For the rates discussed above, the speculator would actually need to hedge, for every dollar borrowed, 0.901 (1.07) = 0.964.\n\nThe interest rate parity relationship between two currencies can be expressed (using indirect quotes) as:\n\nFormula 5.4\n\n(Forward rate - Spot rate) \u00f7 Spot rate = (rfc - rdc) \u00f7 (1 + rdc)\nor (F - S) \u00f7 S= (rfc - rdc) \u00f7 (1 + rdc)\n\nWhere rdc is the risk-free interest rate of the domestic currency, rfc is the risk-free interest rate of the foreign currency and the exchange rates quoted are indirect quotes expressed as the number of units of the foreign currency used to obtain one unit of the domestic currency.\n\nThe interest rate parity relationship can also be expressed as: \nF \u00d7 (1+ rdc) = S \u00d7 (1 + rfc)\n\n\n\n\n\nLook Out!\r\n\t\t\t\tNote that currencies trading at a premium are associated with lower interest rates. Weak currencies must have high risk-free interest rates to compensate for expected depreciation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_119", "text": "\n\nHow Exchange Rates are Determined\nWith a flexible or floating exchange rate system, the value of a currency, as related to other currencies, is determined by the market forces of supply and demand. Suppose that the current exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and British pound is $1.50 = 1 British pound and that Americans then increase their purchases of British goods, while the purchase of U.S. goods by the British stays the same.\nWe would then expect that at that exchange rate, more U.S. dollars are available than are demanded. The exchange rate of the U.S. dollar would be expected to go down until a new equilibrium is achieved. Shifts in supply and demand for a nation's currency will cause the nation's currency to appreciate or depreciate.\nOne advantage of a floating exchange rate system is that it reflects existing economic fundamentals. Another advantage is that governments are not forced to defend some particular exchange rate (or range of rates), and are free to adopt fiscal or monetary policies that are independent of the exchange rate.\nIf you are baffled by exchange rates, or if you are just curious about why some currencies fluctuate while others don't, the following article has the answers:Floating and Fixed Exchange Rates\nThe Balance of Payments\nThe balance of payments measures all financial flows that cross a country's border during a given period of time, typically a quarter or a year. It renders an account of all payments and liabilities to foreigners, and all payments and obligations received from foreigners. For example, when a U.S. company sells a product overseas, that export creates a financial inflow to the U.S., while an American citizen purchasing an imported item creates a negative financial inflow (an outflow). By definition, the sum of all the components of the balance of payments must be equal to zero. \nWith regard to balance-of-payments accounts, there are three major types of accounts:\n1.The Current Account - This type of account records transactions with foreign countries for all current transactions that take place as part of normal business. The current account is specifically made up of:\n\u00b7Imports and exports, which is also called the trade balance or balance of merchandise trade\n\u00b7Services, such as accounting and insurance\n\u00b7Factor payments, such as interest and dividends paid\n\u00b7Current transfers such as gifts, which do not have an associated exchange factor\n2.The Financial Account - Also known as a balance-on-capital account, this account covers changes in ownership of financial and real investments. Parts of this account include:\n\u00b7Net foreign purchases of long-term domestic assets, such as bonds, stock, real estate and other business assets, netted against similar purchases of foreign assets made by the country's citizens\n\u00b7Private transfers of financial assets such as cash and other forms of payments made by domestic entities to foreigners in order to settle balances owed to the foreigners, netted with similar transfers of financial assets from foreigner to domestic entities. \n3.The Official Reserve Account - This account keeps track of all transactions made by monetary authorities. The sum of the current and financial accounts, which is called the overall balance, should be equal to zero. The central bank can use some of its reserves when the overall balance is negative. If the overall balance is positive, the central bank can choose to add to its reserves.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nLook Out!\n\t\t\tKnow these components well - they are critical to understanding later sections.\n\nThe following page will prime you for the topics discussed in this section:What is the Balance of Payments?\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_120", "text": "\n\nCurrent and Financial Account Surpluses and Deficits\nCurrent account deficits (or surpluses) and financial deficits (or surpluses) do not directly affect an economy. In fact, these deficits (surpluses) are actually the result of what is occurring in an economy, instead of being the cause. Trade deficits often occur when a nation's economy is growing faster than the economies of its trading partners. Rapid domestic growth increases the demand for imports, while slow or no growth with foreign economies can cause a decline in demand for the country's exports.\n\nTrade balances are also affected by capital flows. If a nation's economy offers investment opportunities that are relatively better than other nations, then capital will flow into the country. With flexible exchange rates, this capital inflow will tend to increase the value of the nation's currency.\n\nEconomic statistics support the hypothesis that trade deficits are associated with investment opportunities and economic growth. Between 1973 and 1982, which was a time of stagnant economic growth for the U.S., trade deficits and net foreign investment were fairly small. As the U.S. economy grew rapidly after the 1982 recession, net foreign investment greatly increased. During the recession of the early 1990s, capital inflow greatly decreased and the current account was actually slightly positive during one of those years. The time between 1993 and 2000 was one of substantial economic growth; net capital inflows greatly increased, which caused the U.S. dollar to appreciate and the current account ran large deficits.\n\nBudget deficits and trade deficits tend to be linked\nAn increase in the U.S. government budget deficit will cause an increase in the real interest rate, which causes additional foreign capital to flow into the country. The inflow of foreign currencies will cause the value of the U.S. dollar to increase in relation to other currencies. The increase in value of the U.S. dollar will make U.S. exports relatively less attractive to foreigners and imports into the U.S. will be relatively less expensive; therefore, net exports will go down. The increase in the budget deficit leads to an increase in the trade deficit.\n\nCauses of a Nation's Currency Appreciation or Depreciation\nFactors that can cause a nation's currency to appreciate or depreciate include:\n\n\u00b7Relative Product Prices - If a country's goods are relatively cheap, foreigners will want to buy those goods. In order to buy those goods, they will need to buy the nation's currency. Countries with the lowest price levels will tend to have the strongest currencies (those currencies will be appreciating).\n\n\u00b7Monetary Policy - Countries with expansionary (easy) monetary policies will be increasing the supply of their currencies, which will cause the currency to depreciate. Those countries with restrictive (hard) monetary policies will be decreasing the supply of their currency and the currency should appreciate. Note that exchange rates involve the currencies of two countries. If a nation's central bank is pursuing an expansionary monetary policy while its trading partners are pursuing monetary policies that are even more expansionary, the currency of that nation is expected to appreciate relative to the currencies of its trading partners.\n\n\u00b7Inflation Rate Differences - Inflation (deflation) is associated with currency depreciation (appreciation). Suppose the price level increases by 40% in the U.S., while the price levels of its trading partners remain relatively stable. U.S. goods will seem very expensive to foreigners, while U.S. citizens will increase their purchase of relatively cheap foreign goods. The U.S. dollar will depreciate as a result. If the U.S. inflation rate is lower than that of its trading partners, the U.S. dollar is expected to appreciate. Note that exchange rate adjustments permit nations with relatively high inflation rates to maintain trade relations with countries that have low inflation rates.\n\n\u00b7Income Changes - Suppose that the income of a major trading partner with the U.S., such as Great Britain, greatly increases. Greater domestic income is associated with an increased consumption of imported goods. As British consumers purchase more U.S. goods, the quantity of U.S. dollars demanded will exceed the quantity supplied and the U.S. dollar will appreciate. \n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_121", "text": "\nUnanticipated changes in monetary policy will produce both price (substitution) and income effects. For example, suppose monetary authorities begin a program of expansionary (easy) monetary policy.\n\nWe would then expect the following sequence of events to occur with regard to the price effect:\n\n\u00b7Real interest rates will be reduced.\n\u00b7As real interest rates are reduced, domestic financial and capital assets become less attractive as a result of their lower real rates of return. Foreigners will reduce their positions in domestic bonds, real estate, stocks and other assets. The financial account (or balance on capital account) will deteriorate as a result of foreigners holding fewer domestic assets. Domestic investors will be more likely to invest overseas in the pursuit of higher rates of return.\n\u00b7The reduction in domestic investment by foreigners and the country's citizens will decrease the demand for the nation's currency and increase the demand for the currency of foreign countries. The exchange rate of the nation's currency will tend to decline.\n\u00b7With no government intervention, the financial account and the current account must sum to zero. As the financial account declines, the current account will be expected to improve by an equal amount. In other words, the balance of trade should improve. The country's export will have become relatively cheaper and imports will be relatively more expensive.\n\nThe effect of an expansionary monetary policy is to lower the exchange rate, weaken the financial account and strengthen the current account. A restrictive monetary policy would be expected to result in the opposite: a higher exchange rate, a stronger financial account and a weaker current account (a more negative, or a less positive balance of trade).\n\nWith a program of expansionary (easy) monetary policy, the following sequence of events would be expected to occur with regard to the income effect:\n\n\u00b7The domestic GDP will rise.\n\u00b7The rise in domestic GDP will tend to increase the demand for imports. The increase in imports will cause the current account to deteriorate.\n\u00b7The increase in imports purchased will increase the need to convert domestic to foreign currency. As a result, the exchange rate of the domestic currency will decrease.\n\u00b7With no government intervention, the financial account must now move toward a surplus as the financial and current account must sum to zero. Due to the increase in imports, foreigners will now have a surplus of the nation's currency. If foreigners do not use that currency to purchase the country's exports (which would improve the current account balance), they will ultimately need to invest that currency in the assets of the domestic country. This explains why countries such as China and Japan invest large sums in assets such as U.S. Treasuries. The holders of the U.S. currency must put it to work somewhere! Note that foreign investors are often getting better rates of return than what might be readily apparent because the value of the domestic currency is falling relative to their own currency.\n\nIn summary, the income effect of expansionary monetary policy tends to lower the domestic currency exchange rate, weaken the current account and work to improve the financial account. A restrictive monetary policy tends to cause the opposite due to the income effect. The domestic currency exchange rate increases, the current account improves and the financial account weakens.\n\nAs both price and the income effects of monetary policy move in the same direction regarding their impact on the exchange rate, it is clear that expansionary (restrictive) monetary policy will lower (raise) the country's exchange rate. The effect of monetary policy on the current and financial accounts is not so clear because the price and income effects move in opposite directions. For example, the price effect of easy money on the current account tends to strengthen it, while the income effect tends to weaken the current account. Since the effects move in opposite directions, it is not immediately clear what the ultimate impact will be.\n\nWe should note that investors can buy and sell financial assets such as stocks and bonds more quickly than producers and consumers can sell and buy physical goods. So initially, interest rate (substitution) effects would be expected to dominate. An unanticipated increase in the money supply will cause the exchange rate to go down, the financial account to weaken and current account to gain strength. Over time, the income effect will come into play. A rising GDP will cause both the trade balance and financial account to weaken.\n\nSome argue that for an economy with a foreign sector, monetary policy can create cyclical movements that tend to destabilize an economy. Unanticipated expansionary monetary policy initially causes the trade balance to improve, but as time progresses, it causes the trade balance to become more negative. It initially causes the capital account to weaken due to lower interest rates, but then later tends to improve it. In the long run, the main effect of the expansionary monetary policy is a lowering of the nation's currency exchange rate, which is the international equivalent to the long-run effect of expansionary monetary policy, inflation. Empirical evidence indicates that countries with high rates of monetary supply growth experience both inflation and declining currency exchange rates. An important point to consider is the exchange rates of two countries - their relative rates of money supply growth will help determine how the exchange rate changes.\n\nFiscal policy changes will produce both price (substitution) and income effects for exchange rates and balance of payments. Suppose government policymakers enact a program of unanticipated fiscal stimulus. This would be expected to cause the following sequence of events to occur with regard to the price effect:\n\n\u00b7Greater government budget deficits caused by tax cuts and/or increased spending will increase the demand for investable funds, which will cause interest rates to rise.\n\u00b7The increase in interest rates will cause capital inflows (foreigners will purchase more domestic financial assets). As a result, the capital account will strengthen (become more positive or less negative).\n\u00b7Foreign investors will need to exchange their currency for the domestic currency. The increased demand for the domestic currency will cause its exchange rate to increase.\n\u00b7If there is no government intervention with the balance-of-payments, the current account will need to become more negative (or less positive). The trade balance will weaken as imports increase and/or exports decrease. This makes sense because the strengthening of the nation's currency will make its exports relatively less attractive to foreigners and imports will be less expensive relative to the country's consumers and domestic businesses.\n\nTo summarize, the price effect of a stimulative fiscal policy is to raise the value of the domestic currency, strengthen the capital account and weaken the current account. A restrictive fiscal policy would have the opposite effects: a weaker domestic currency, a weaker capital account (there would be net capital outflows) and a stronger current account.\n\nWith a program of fiscal stimulus, the following sequence of events would be expected to occur with regard to the income effect:\n\n\u00b7The tax cuts and/or increase in government spending associated with the fiscal policy, and the associated multiplier effect, will increase GDP.\n\u00b7The rise in GDP will cause the demand for imports to increase and the current account will be weakened (become more negative or less positive).\n\u00b7More domestic currency will need to be converted into foreign currencies to purchase the increased quantity of imports. The increased supply of domestic currency on the international markets will cause the exchange rate to decline.\n\u00b7With no government intervention, the financial account will need to become more positive (or less negative) in order to compensate for the weakening of the current account. Foreigners will be holding more of the domestic currency and are therefore in a position to purchase more of the nation's financial assets. Also, as the domestic economy is improving, they may find it more attractive as a place to invest.\n\nTo summarize, the income effect associated with fiscal stimulus will tend to lower the exchange rate of the country's currency, weaken the current account (trade balance) and strengthen the financial account.\n\nFiscal policy price and income effects move in the same direction with regard to their impact on the financial and current accounts. Stimulating fiscal policy will clearly weaken the current account (balance of trade) and strengthen the capital account. Restrictive fiscal policy will strengthen the current account (balance of trade) and weaken the capital account.\n\nThe impact of fiscal policy on exchange rates is not so clear because the price and income effects work in opposite directions. The income effect tends to weaken the currency exchange rate, while the price effect will tend to strengthen the currency exchange rate. Because foreign investors can trade financial assets (such as stocks and bonds) more quickly and easily than consumers and producers can alter the purchase and sale of physical assets, the price effect would be expected to have the larger initial effect. Over time, the income effect will increasingly come into play.\n\nSo initially, the fiscal stimulus should cause the domestic currency to appreciate. Over time, as the demand for imports is stimulated, the domestic currency will weaken. If the fiscal stimulus is associated with inflation, there will be a further weakening of the domestic currency. Note that the fiscal stimulus will also have the effect of worsening the balance of trade and increasing the financial account in both the short and long run.\n\nA stimulative fiscal policy is good for the economy when it is operating below full employment levels. There are a couple of factors that will mitigate the positive effects. One factor is that government deficits will work to increase interest rates, which can crowd out private investment. Another factor is that after foreign capital comes in (due to higher interest rates), the domestic currency exchange rate rises. This leads to a rise in imports, which reduces GDP. These two factors lessen the positive effects of fiscal policy stimulus.\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_122", "text": "\nA fixed exchange rate system maintains fixed exchange rates between currencies; those rates are referred to as official parity. A nation with fixed exchange rates must enforce those rates. An early form of fixed exchange rates was to specify the value of a nation's currency in terms of gold (the \"gold standard\").\n\nThe Gold Standard\nThe gold standard system worked reasonably well during the 1800s, but it was gradually disbanded during the twentieth century. In 1944, leading non-communist nations agreed on a fixed exchange rate system (the Bretton Woods System) whereby the value of the U.S. dollar was pegged at $35 per ounce and other nations then fixed the value of their currencies in relation to the U.S. dollar. Private individuals could not acquire gold at that price; only governments traded gold at that price. During the 1960s, the U.S. government pursued an expansionary monetary policy in an attempt to finance the Vietnam War and increase domestic entitlement programs (\"guns and butter\") without raising taxes. The inflationary monetary policy induced nations to begin a run on U.S. gold, and the U.S. was forced to stop redeeming dollars for gold and break the fixed exchange rate system that had been started in 1944. \n\nRead more on the Gold Standard's rise and fall in the following article:\nThe Gold Standard Revisited\n\nA nation operating under a fixed exchange rate system (pegged to the dollar) that experiences a balance of payments deficit will be forced to finance the deficit out of its dollar reserves. As the number of dollars declines, the nation's money supply is reduced. This causes prices to drop and interest rates to increase. The price drops make the nation's goods more competitive internationally; the higher interest rates also cause more capital to flow into the country. These forces help the nation to achieve equilibrium with its balance of payments.\n\nThe advantages of fixed exchange rate systems include the elimination of exchange rate risk, at least in the short run. They also bring discipline to government monetary and fiscal policies. Disadvantages include lack of monetary independence and increases in currency speculation regarding possible revaluations.\n\nPegged Exchange Rate System\nA pegged exchange rate system is a hybrid of fixed and floating exchange rate regimes. Typically, a country will \"peg\" its currency to a major currency such as the U.S. dollar, or to a basket of currencies. The choice of the currency (or basket of currencies) is affected by the currencies in which the country's external debt is denominated and the extent to which the country's trade is concentrated with particular trading partners. The case for pegging to a single currency is made stronger if the peg is to the currency of a principal trading partner. If much of the country's debt is denominated in other currencies, the choice of which currency to peg it to becomes more complicated.\n\nTypically, with a pegged exchange rate, an initial target exchange rate is set and the actual exchange rate will be allowed to fluctuate in a range around that initial target rate. Also, given changes in economic fundamentals, the target exchange rate may be modified.\n\nPegged exchange rates are typically used by smaller countries. To defend a particular rate, they may need to resort to central bank intervention, the imposition of tariffs or quotas, or the placement of restrictions on capital flow. If the pegged exchange rate is too far from the actual market rate, it will be costly to defend and it will probably not last. Currency speculators may benefit from such a situation.Advantages of pegged exchange rates include a reduction in the volatility of the exchange rate (at least in the short-run) and the imposition of some discipline on government policies. One disadvantage is that it can introduce currency speculation.\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_123", "text": "\nPurchasing power parity is the notion that a bundle of goods in one country should cost the same in another after exchange rates are considered.\n\nThere are two ways to express this concept:\n\n1. Absolute Purchasing Power Parity\nThis concept posits that the exchange rate between two countries will be identical to the ratio of the price levels for those two countries. This concept is derived from a basic idea known as the law of one price, which states that the real price of a good must be the same across all countries. To illustrate why this makes sense, suppose that soybeans are currently priced at $5 a bushel in the U.S., that soybeans are priced at \u00ac5.50 per bushel in Europe, and that the exchange rate is 1.10 euros per dollar. Suppose that the price of soybeans goes up to \u00ac6.05 per bushel (a 10% increase) in Europe, while the price of soybeans in the U.S. only goes up on 5%, to $5.25 a bushel. If there is no depreciation in the euro to offset the 5% difference, then European soybeans will not be competitive on the international market and trade flowing from the U.S. to Europe will greatly increase.\n\nIf we take weighted averages of prices for all goods within an economy, absolute purchase power parity maintains that the currency exchange rate between two countries should be identical to the ratio of the two countries' price levels.\n\nThis relationship can be expressed as:\n\nFormula 5.5\r\nS= P \u00f7 P*\n\nWhere Sis the spot exchange rate between two countries (the rate of the amount of foreign currency needed to trade for the domestic currency), P is the price index for a domestic country and P* is the price index for a foreign country. Note that the exchange rate used here is an indirect quote.\n\nThe following conditions must be met for this relationship to be true: \n1.The goods of each country must be freely tradable on the international market.\n\n2.The price index for each of the two countries must be comprised of the same basket of goods.\n\n3.All of the prices need to be indexed to the same year.\n\nEven if the law of one price holds for each individual good across countries, differences in weighting will cause absolute purchasing power parity. Determining comparable average national price levels is actually quite difficult and is rarely attempted. Analysts usually examine changes in price levels (indexes), which are easier to calculate; this gets around some of the problems of comparability.\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_124", "text": "\nRelative purchasing power parity relates the change in two countries' expected inflation rates to the change in their exchange rates. Inflation reduces the real purchasing power of a nation's currency. If a country has an annual inflation rate of 10%, that country's currency will be able to purchase 10% less real goods at the end of one year. Relative purchasing power parity examines the relative changes in price levels between two countries and maintains that exchange rates will change to compensate for inflation differentials.\nThe relationship can be expressed as follows, using indirect quotes:\nFormula 5.6\nS1 / S0 = (1 + Iy) \u00f7 (1 + Ix)\nWhere,\nS0 is the spot exchange rate at the beginning of the time period (measured as the \"y\" country price of one unit of currency x)\nS1 is the spot exchange rate at the end of the time period.\nIy is the expected annualized inflation rate for country y, which is considered to be the foreign country.\nIx is the expected annualized inflation rate for country x, which is considered to be the domestic country.\n\u00a0\nLook Out!\n\t\t\tNote that the spot exchange rate used must be the quantity of currency y (the foreign currency) needed to purchase one unit of currency x (the domestic currency). If we want the spot value of the U.S. dollar in British pounds, the quote must be 0.6667 British pounds per dollar, not $1.50 per British pound. \n\nExample 1:\nSuppose that Mexico's expected annual rate of inflation is equal to 6% per year, while the expected annual inflation rate for the U.S. is 3%. As an approximation, we would expect that the Mexican peso would depreciate at the rate of 3% per year (or we could say that the U.S. dollar should appreciate at the rate of 3% per year.\nExample 2:\nSuppose that the annual inflation rate is expected to be 8% in the Eurozone and 2% in the U.S. The current exchange rate is $1.20 per euro (\u00ac1.00 = $1.20). What would the expected spot exchange rate be in six months for the euro?\nAnswer:\nSo the relevant equation is:\nS0.5 \u00f7 S0 = (( 1 + Ius) \u00f7 (1 + Ieurozone))0.5\n= S0.5 \u00f7 $1.20 per euro = (1.02 \u00f7 1.08)0.5\nWhich implies S0.5 = (1.20) \u00d7 0.978125 = 1.1662\nSo the expected spot exchange rate at the end of six months would be $1.1662 per euro. \nExample 3:\nAssume that the U.S. is the foreign country and that Japan is the domestic country. The current spot exchange rate is S0 = 115 yen per dollar ($1 per \u00a5115.00). The expected annual inflation rate for the U.S. is 4.89%, and the annual expected Japanese inflation rate is 6.23%. Compute the approximate expected spot rate and the expected spot rate one year from now.\nAnswer:\nBecause Japan is the domestic country we have:\nS0 = 115 yen per dollar. (1 + Iy) is 1.0489, and (1 + Ix) is equal to 1.0623.\nThe approximation method would indicate that the yen should decline against the dollar by: 1.0623 - 1.0489 = 0.0134 = 1.34%\nSo the value of the yen relative to the dollar would be expected to decline to\n(1 + 0.0134) \u00d7 115  = \u00a5116.54 per $\nWe can calculate the rate more exactly as:\nS1 = (1.0623) / (1.0489) \u00d7 115 = \u00a5116.47 per $\nPurchasing Power Parity and Real Return on Assets\nThe purchasing power parity principle also applies to the real returns on assets earned by various investors across the world. It holds that the real rate of return on assets should be the same for investors from any nation.\nSuppose that a financial asset from Mexico has an annual rate of return of 10% in Mexican pesos. Assume that Mexico has an annual inflation rate of 4%, the U.S. has an annual inflation rate of 2% and that the U.S. dollar is appreciating by 2% a year, as predicted by purchasing power parity.\nBy the approximation method, U.S. investors would be earning about 8% per year in terms of Mexican pesos. Their real rate of return would be approximately 6% per year after U.S. inflation is taken into account. This is equal to what Mexican investors are earning, which is about 6% (10% nominal rate of return - 4% inflation). All investors are getting the same real rate of return on specific assets.\nNote that purchasing power parity is a theoretical concept that may not be true in the real world, especially in the short run. \n\u00a0\n\nExam Tip!\n Past exams have included questions that require purchasing power parity calculations, so it is a good idea to practice solving questions such as the examples given above. \n\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_125", "text": "\nOutline of the Income Statement\nThe income statement (also known as the statement of operations, statement earnings, profit and loss (P&L) statement) is, in outline:\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nRevenue\n\n\n\u00a0The income generated during the period arising\n\n\nMinus\n\n\nExpenses\n\n\n\u00a0The costs incurred in generating that revenue/income\u00a0\n\n\nEquals\u00a0\n\n\n\nNet income\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u00a0Net profit for the period\n\nRevenue is the income derived from the company\u2019s primary business activities.

What profit will be shown over each of the next ten years where the seller uses the cost recovery method?\nSolution\nEach year, the cost recognized is determined by the percentage of the cash consideration received, however no profit is recorded until the cash received exceeds the total costs. Hence, as 10% ($400,000/$4,000,000) of the total revenue is received each year, 10% of the total costs ($3m \u00d7 10% = $300,000) is recognized each year, although no profit is recorded until Year 8 when the total cash receipts first exceed the total cost of $3m.\nOf the $400,000 received in each of the first seven years, $300,000 is regarded as revenue (so that no profit is recognized) and $100,000 is treated as unearned revenue, hence there is $700,000 of accumulated unearned revenue by the end of Year 7.\nIn Year 8, accumulated cash receipts reach $3.2 million hence, against a total cost of $3 million, a profit of $200,000 needs to be recognized by recognizing $500,000 of revenue against the $300,000 cost recognized for the year, the revenue being the $400,000 cash received plus $100,000 from the accumulated unearned revenue.\nIn Years 9 and 10, we need to recognize $400,000 of profit each year as all of the cash receipts now exceed the original cost. This is achieved by recognizing $700,000 of revenue against the $300,000 cost recognized for the year, the revenue being the $400,000 cash received plus $300,000 from the accumulated unearned revenue in each of these last two years.\n\nBarter transaction (LOS 7.24b and c)\nBy the end of Year 10, all revenue, costs and profits have been recognized and there is no remaining accumulated unearned revenue.\nDefinition: Transactions where companies transfer goods or services in return for other goods/services, e.g. exchanges of advertising space on websites.\nAccounting treatment\n\nIFRS: Recognize revenue based on the fair value of the revenue from similar non-barter transactions with unrelated parties.\n\n\nFASB: Revenue can be recognized based on the fair value only if the company has historically received cash payments for the goods or services.\n\nGross vs net reporting (LOS 7.24b and c)\nAccounting issue: The issue arises where goods are shipped by an intermediary from a supplier straight to a customer, the intermediary never having any involvement other than facilitating the transaction. For example, an intermediary buys goods for $100 and sells them on for $110 incurring costs of $4. They have clearly made a profit of $6 but should they recognize turnover of $110 and costs of $104 (gross reporting) or turnover of $10 and costs or $4 (net reporting)?\nAccounting treatment: To be able to report gross revenues, the intermediary company must:\n\nBe primary obligor\n\n\nBear inventory and credit risk\n\n\nBe able to choose suppliers and have latitude to determine their own selling price\n\nRevenue Recognition Accounting Standards Issued May 2014 (LOS 7.24d)\nConverged accounting standards issued by the IASB and FASB in May 2014 introduced some basic changes to the principles of revenue recognition designed to enhance comparability. The standards were effective from 1 January 2017 under IFRS and 15 December 2016 under US GAAP.\nThe core principle of the converged standard is that revenue should be recognized to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects consideration to which entity expects to be entitled in an exchange for those goods or services.\nThe standard applies five steps in recognizing revenue:\n\nIdentify the contract(s) with a customer\n\n\nIdentify the performance obligations in the contract\n\n\nDetermine the transaction price\n\n\nAllocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract\n\n\nRecognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies the performance obligation\n\nExam focus\nReading 24 lays out the criteria for revenue recognition under US GAAP and IFRS. You should learn these in case you get a direct knowledge question asking you to recall them. However, it is likely to be more important to focus on the special instances of revenue recognition and to be able to outline the accounting treatment for these transactions. At first glance, it looks like the criteria are different between the two accounting codes, however, the criteria are very similar\u2014the IFRS criteria is just worded more formally. One criteria that is missing from both sets of criteria is the need for cash to have been received to be able to recognize revenue. This criteria is not required by either accounting code and is the key concept underpinning revenue recognition.\nIt is important to work through the revenue examples within Reading 24 since this will allow you to calculate the revenue to be recognized under each of the transactions shown, although it is unlikely that the exam questions will follow the exact format of the examples in the readings. It is much more likely that you will have to deal with a different scenario and apply your knowledge. Remember, the key principle of accrual accounting is the ability to recognize revenue independently of cash collection. This is the same for both US GAAP and IFRS.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe Study Guides and other exam prep information available on Investopedia are for informational purposes only.

They represent decreases in economic benefits during the accounting period in the form of outflows, depletions of assets, or liabilities incurred that result in decreases in equity, other than those relating to distributions to equity participants.\nIASB definition: Decreases in economic benefits during the accounting period in the form of outflows or depletions of assets or incurrence of liabilities that result in decreases in equity, other than those relating to distributions to equity participants.\nGeneral accounting principles:\n\nMatching principle: Costs and revenues should be matched in order to fairly reflect profits, e.g. match the revenue from making a sale to the cost of the goods actually sold and any other expenses incurred in making that sale.\n\n\nPeriod costs: If expenses cannot be directly matched with revenues then recognize in the period in which they are incurred, e.g. administrative expenses.\n\nIssues in expense recognition: warranties (LOS 7.24e)\nA warranty is an agreement with a supplier under which that supplier will pay for repairs to a product they have supplied should it prove to be faulty.\nAccounting issue: at the time of making the sale, the company does not know:\n\nWhether it will incur any future expense or not (will a warranty claim be made or not?)\n\n\nWhen it will incur that expense if it does arise\n\n\nThe scale of that expense if it does arise\n\nHence, at the time of sale the company must recognize a provision for estimated warranty costs, consistent with the matching principle.\n\nWarranties: example (LOS 7.24e)\nExample\nA white goods manufacturer offers a one-year warranty on the products it sells. The average product sells for $200 and, on average, there is a warranty claim on 2% of the items, the average cost of each claim being $50. If the manufacturer sells 100,000 items during the year:\na)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 What revenue and warranty cost will initially be recognized in relation to these items?\nb)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 If the manufacturer actually incurs $90,000 in warranty costs in respect of these items before the warranty period expires, how will the warranty costs be accounted for?\nSolution\na)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Revenue and warranty initially recognized\nRevenue = 100,000 \u00d7 $200 = $20,000,000\nExpected number of warranty claims = 100,000 \u00d7 2% = 2,000\nExpected warranty cost = 2,000 \u00d7 $50 = $100,000, or $1 per item\nAs the warranty costs are not paid immediately but are paid later when they arise, they will be recognized on the balance sheet as a liability rather than a cash outflow.\nb)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Warranty costs paid\nA warranty provision (liability) of $100,000 was established when the items were sold. If $90,000 is paid in relation to all warranty claims on these items, this cash payment would reduce the liability by $90,000 with the remaining $10,000 being released back into profits as a reduction in the warranty expense (liabilities down, warranty expenses down). If the amount paid exceeded $100,000 the excess would be an additional warranty expense that will be recognized when paid.\nExam focus\nThe general concept underpinning the recognition of expenses is to try to match revenue with expenses or, if this is not possible, the time period in which the expenditure was incurred or the time period of expected benefits of the expenditures such as depreciation. Exam questions will focus on testing your understanding of how the accounting for doubtful accounts, warranties, and depreciation affects financial analysis.\nIn summary, the reason the analyst needs to examine these items thoroughly is that they tend to be areas where judgment is applied to the accounting policy choices. Where there is room to apply judgment, there is often a lack of direct comparability between different companies. This makes it important for an analyst to check whether they are comparing \u2018apples to apples\u2019 when reading a set of financial statements. Although the exam is multiple choice, if you can do this, you will be able to tackle any exam question on this topic.\n\u00a0\nThe Study Guides and other exam prep information available on Investopedia are for informational purposes only.

Examples that will typically be found in company accounts include gains or losses arising from:\n\nDiscontinued operations and the disposal of a portion of a business segment\n\n\nExtraordinary items\n\n\nUnusual or infrequent items\n\n\nAsset impairments\n\nThe purpose of reporting them separately is to ensure the user of the accounts does not get a distorted impression of the company\u2019s performance, and analysts will need to take a view on the potential of a recurrence of these items in future years. As a result of the potential for giving a distorted impression, it is not advisable to simply ignore unusual items.\nDiscontinued operations (LOS 7.24f and g)\nWhere a business establishes a plan to dispose of a distinct operation or division, it is important to identify the performance of that division so that the users of the accounts can appreciate the impact the ultimate disposal will have when it takes place. Consequently, the profits or losses of any such division should be disclosed separately on the income statement.\nSuch items must be reported separately to ensure that user of the accounts does not get a distorted impression of the company\u2019s performance, and analysts will need to take a view on the potential of a recurrence of these items in future years. Again, as a result of the potential for giving a distorted impression, it is not advisable to simply ignore such unusual items.\nExtraordinary items (LOS 7.24f and g)\nExtraordinary items were large one-off items that may be seen in older sets of accounts, however they have been prohibited under IFRS for many years, and prohibited under US GAAP for reporting periods beginning on or after December 16, 2015.\nExtraordinary items were defined as items that were both:\n\nUnusual in nature; and\n\n\nInfrequent in occurrence\n\nThey were disclosed separately in the income statement, net of tax below discontinued operations, i.e. specifically not part of operating activities.\nThe classification of something as an extraordinary item was often contentious and was often ruled on by standard setters. For example, Hurricane Katrina in 2005 was not considered extraordinary, just unusual or infrequent. All such items now fall to be classed as unusual or infrequent items which are now reported separately as part of income from continuing operations.\nUnusual or infrequent items (LOS 7.24f and g)\nDefinition: unusual or infrequent items are items of income or expense that are material, hence relevant to the understanding of the entity\u2019s financial performance. Typical examples would include:\n\nRestructuring charges: Such as the costs of closing factories, disposing of plant, terminating employees, etc. are considered part of a company\u2019s ordinary activities on the basis that companies need to continue to evolve to meet changing circumstances.\n\n\nGains and losses on asset disposals/discontinued activities: Gains or losses arising when a company sells an asset or part of a business at a value that differs from its balance sheet carrying value.\n\nAccounting treatment: \n\nIFRS: IFRS require that unusual or infrequent items should be disclosed separately to aid the user in their understanding of the accounts.\n\n\nUS GAAP: For accounting periods beginning on or after December 16, 2015, US GAAP requires such items to be shown as part of a company\u2019s continuing operations, but presented separately.\n\nSuch items must be reported separately to ensure the user of the accounts does not get a distorted impression of the company\u2019s performance, and analysts will need to take a view on the potential of a recurrence of these items in future years. As a result of the potential for giving a distorted impression, it is not advisable to simply ignore such unusual items.\nAccounting changes (LOS 7.24f and g)\nAccounting changes may fall under one of three classifications with the appropriate accounting treatment depending on the classification, as follows:\n\nChanges in estimates: Accounts are not wholly objective and may contain a number of accounting estimates, such as the expected useful life of an asset for depreciation purposes. Any change in such estimates, such as a change in the expected useful life of an asset, only affects the period of change and future accounting periods, there is no requirement to restate the figures for any prior periods.\n\n\nChanges in principles: Accounting rules and regulations are subject to change as principles are developed and, since 2005, both US GAAP and IFRS have required the restatement of prior periods that are shown in a company\u2019s financial report, the restatement showing the position and performance of the company as if the newly adopted accounting principle had always been used.\n\n\nChanges only applied to new transactions: No adjustment required.\n\nExam focus\nIn order for an analyst to value a company\u2019s equity accurately, they will often have to start by considering what a normal profit or cash flow level is. From here, the analyst can forecast a more accurate future position. You will often find exam questions testing the accounting treatment of discontinued operations, extraordinary items, unusual or infrequent items and changes in accounting policies and the differences between the treatment under IFRS and US GAAP.\n\u00a0\nThe Study Guides and other exam prep information available on Investopedia are for informational purposes only.

It shows the performance achieved by the company for each share held.\nYou may like to view our Introduction to EPS tutorial before progressing further https://bcove.video/2Bx2NbM.\n\u00a0Importance: The EPS figure:\n\nEnables each shareholder to determine their share of the earnings of the company, aiding the comparison between companies.\n\n\nProvides an input into the price/earnings ratio for share valuations/investment analysis purposes.\n\n\nIs required by IASB and FASB for presentation on the face of the income statement.\n\nBasic calculation:\nAt its most basic, the calculation is:\n\nWhere a company has only common shares in issue the numerator (top line) will simply be the net income. However, where the company also has preference shares in issue, part of this net income will be payable to the holders of those preference shares as a preference dividend with only the remainder of the net income being attributable to the holders of common shares. Thus the formula becomes:\n\nHowever, as it is not uncommon for companies to issue shares during the year, and as a result, the calculation will more normally be expressed as:\n\nDetermining the weighted average number of shares (LOS 7.24h)\n\u00a0\nAs the earnings in the numerator (top line) of this ratio have been generated across the entire year, it is important to compare them to a number of shares in the denominator (bottom line) that is representative of the number of shares in issue throughout the year, i.e. the weighted average number of shares. Where a company has not issued shares during the year this will simply be the number of shares outstanding at the year-end. However, this is unlikely to be the case as companies frequently undertake:\n\nStock issues/stock repurchases: For such transactions, the weighting of the shares is based on the date of purchase/repurchase, i.e. time weighted.\n\n\nStock splits/stock dividends: Under the treasury stock method we assume the newly issued shares have always been in existence, hence the date of the stock split/stock dividend is, to an extent, irrelevant. To deal with this in calculating the weighted average number of common shares we must scale up the actual number of shares in issue prior to the stock split/stock dividend date, and a restatement of prior year EPS is also required for consistency.\n\nBasic EPS calculation (LOS 7.24h)\nPlease watch our tutorial explaining how to calculate the EPS prior to working through the examples below: https://bcove.video/2kap5Mw.\nExample\nDuring the year to December 31 2018, a company generates net income for the year of $50,000, paying dividends to preferred stockholders of $20,000 and dividends to common stockholders of $15,000. The company had 5,000 shares in issue at the start of the year and undertook the following common stock transactions during the year:\n\n1 April: Shares issued 2,000\n\n\n1 July: 10% stock dividend\n\n\n1 September: Shares repurchased 1,500\n\nCalculate the basic EPS.\nSolution\nEarnings \nEarnings = Net income \u2013 Preference dividends = $50,000 \u2013 $20,000 = $30,000\nWeighted average number of shares\n\u00a0\n\n\nEarnings per share\nDiluted EPS (LOS 7.24i)\nIn addition to issuing shares during the year, a company may also issue (or have in issue) securities that may potentially be converted into common stock, in which event they may reduce (dilute) the earnings available to each share of common stock. The diluted EPS indicates the worst-case dilutive impact that such conversions may have and is calculated as follows.\n\nSecurities that may potentially be converted into common stock include:\nConvertible bonds\n\nConvertible preferred stock\n\n\nEmployee stock options\n\n\nWarrants\n\nConverting these securities will clearly increase the number of shares in issue, however it may also increase the earnings by, say, reducing interest expenses or preference dividends and two possibilities arise:\n\nDilutive: Where the percentage increase in earnings < the percentage increase in the weighted average number of shares the conversion will reduce the EPS, i.e. diluted EPS < basic EPS\n\n\nAnti-dilutive: Where the percentage increase in earnings \u2265 the percentage increase in the weighted average number of shares the conversion will not reduce the EPS, i.e. diluted EPS \u2265 basic EPS\n\nThe diluted EPS calculation should only take account of any potential dilutive conversions, anti-dilutive securities are disregarded so as not to affect the worst-case impact by offsetting dilutive securities.\nDiluted EPS: convertible debt (LOS 7.24i)\nUsing the if-converted method, we determine what the EPS would have been if the convertible debt had been converted at the beginning of the period, i.e. we adjust the:\n\nEarnings: for the post-tax effect on the interest saved following conversion.\n\n\nWeighted average number of shares: for the number of additional shares which would now be in issue following conversion\n\nExample\nA company has a net income of $23,120, common stock of 4,000 shares in issue through the entire year and 2,000 $100 10% preference shares in issue throughout the year. During the previous year, the company issued 120 $1,000 8% convertible bonds for $120,000, each being convertible into 100 shares of common stock.\nAssuming the company faces a tax rate of 40%, calculate the basic and diluted EPS based on this information.\nSolution\n\n\nUsing the if-converted method, we determine what the EPS would have been if the convertible preference stock had been converted at the beginning of the period, i.e. we adjust the:\u00a0Diluted EPS: convertible preference stock (LOS 7.24i)\n\nEarnings: for the preference dividends saved following conversion.\n\n\nWeighted average number of shares: for the number of additional shares which would now be in issue following conversion\n\nExample\nA company has a net income of $23,120, common stock of 4,000 shares in issue through the entire year and 2,000 $100 10% preference shares in issue throughout the year. Each preference share is convertible into 20 shares of common stock.\nAssuming the company faces a tax rate of 40%, calculate the basic and diluted EPS based on this information.\nSolution\n\n\nThe CFA\u00ae Program curriculum readings do not cover the method of calculating EPS when there is more than one dilutive security.\u00a0\nDiluted EPS: dilutive stock options/warrants (LOS 7.24i)\nUsing the treasury stock method, we determine what the EPS would have been if the options/warrants had been exercised and the proceeds used to repurchase common stock at the beginning of the period (based on the average share price throughout the period), hence:\n\nEarnings: No adjustment is required as there is no change to either income or expenses.\n\n\nWeighted average number of shares: We must adjust for the number of additional shares issued on the exercise of the option/warrants less the number of shares the company would have purchased in the market at the average price for the year.\n\nExample\nA company has net income of $23,120, common stock of 4,000 shares in issue through the entire year and 2,000 non-convertible $100 10% preference shares in issue throughout the year. Throughout the year the company also has 2,000 stock options in issue, each of which converts into 10 shares of common stock at a strike price of $15 per share. The average price of a share of common stock during the year was $20.\nAssuming the company faces a tax rate of 40%, calculate the basic and diluted EPS based on this information.\nSolution\n\nExam focus\nIt is easy to compare the net income of two companies, however, simply looking at the absolute level of profit may not be useful if they have very different levels of share capital. Instead analysts prefer to look at the relative profitability of a company or its earnings per share (EPS). For this reason, EPS is an important performance indicator and as such it is imperative for a good analyst to completely understand how this metric is calculated. In order to compare companies, which have different operating strategies and also different capital structures, an analyst may have to understand the effects that the differences have on the EPS calculation itself.

Most of the application of this involves being familiar with the items normally found on the balance sheet and knowing how they are presented. The most important area of the reading to focus on is equity, since this is a common area of confusion for those new to accounting. Equity is essentially the owners\u2019 claim on a company\u2019s assets after having paid off its liabilities.\nAlthough balance sheet ratios are covered in more depth later, the key skill you should take from this reading is that by comparing asset levels to liability levels, an analyst can judge whether the company has cash to pay off debts in the short-term. Also, by\u00a0comparing the level of debt to the level of equity, an analyst can judge whether the company has a stable and solvent capital structure to ensure that it is able to meet its obligations over the longer term. It is important that you master these concepts as they do form the basis of exam questions.\n\u00a0\nThe Study Guides and other exam prep information available on Investopedia are for informational purposes only.

It should be deceptively simple\u2014the cash flow statement just lists actual cash flows, whereas net income is distorted by accrual-based income and expense figures.

Here is how it works.\nCash flow analysis\nLOS 7.26h Analyze and interpret both reported and common-size cash flow statements.\nThe evaluation of the cash flow statement involves an overall assessment of the various sources and uses of cash within each category of the cash flow statement: operating, investing and financing.\nThe objective is to assess the main drivers of the business cash flows, i.e.:\n\nMajor sources and uses of cash: In mature companies this tends to be operating activities, whereas newer growing companies may experience higher investing and financing cash flows as they raise finance to invest and grow the business.\n\n\nPrimary determinants of operating, investing\u00a0and financing cash flow:\nOperating cash flows: A business needs to be viable based on its trading operations, hence we should compare the operating cash flow to net income for each year, giving an indication of earnings quality. Other than for non-cash items (e.g. depreciation) we would expect there to be a good match in the long term, however we should expect shorter term fluctuations due to cyclical factors impacting on the business. However, if there is a significant and persistent mismatch, the analyst should investigate the cause and consider the possible consequences.\nInvesting cash flows: The analyst should review the purchase of assets or businesses to determine whether they are consistent with the level of, or changes in the level of, operations and operational cash flows.\nFinancing cash flows: The analyst should investigate the nature of any financing and any financing cash flows in order to consider the possible consequences, such as the requirement to pay higher dividends if shares have been issued, or the need to repay debt when it matures.\n\nCommon size analysis\nLOS 7.26h Analyze and interpret both reported and common-size cash flow statements\nIt is often very difficult to compare two different companies if they are of a substantially different scale, however one way of tackling this is to undertake a common size analysis. The balance sheet, income statement and cash flow statement can all be analyzed on a common size basis in which:\n\nBalance sheet: Each asset, liability and equity item is expressed as a percentage of total assets.\n\n\nIncome statement: Each income and expense line item is expressed as a percentage of net revenues.\n\n\nCash flow statement: Two common alternative approaches:\nExpress each cash flow line item as a percentage of total inflows (outflows).\nExpress each cash flow line item as a percentage of net revenue.\n\nBy considering companies on a common size basis we can compare companies of different sizes to see if the cash flow patterns are similar, and we can investigate whether/how/why they are different and what the implications of any difference may be.\nIllustration\nWe are trying to compare the cash flows of two companies, Company A and Company B, whose cash flow details are given below.\n\nAs we can see, these are two substantially differently sized companies, making it very difficult to undertake a comparison based on the dollar figures.\nIf, however, we present the information on a common size basis we may find the following:\n\nAs we can see when we look at the common size percentage figures, the breakdown of the sources and uses cash are substantially similar in the two companies, i.e. they appear to be trading in an identical manner despite their difference in scale.\nFree cash flow\nLOS 7.26i Calculate and interpret free cash flow to the firm, free cash flow to equity, and performance and coverage cash flow ratios.\nFree cash flow is useful for valuation purposes and for identifying potential risks, the idea being to determine the level of cash flow after making all non-discretionary payments.\nFree cash flow is typically determined at two different levels, each of which we examine below.\nFree cash flow to the firm (FCFF)\nThe first measure, that we can simply call free cash flow but which may also be referred to as free cash flow to the firm, is the actual cash that would be available to the company\u2019s investors after making all necessary non-discretionary payments and all investments necessary to maintain the company as an ongoing enterprise.\nThis sum represents funds that can be freely distributed to the company\u2019s investors (shareholders and bondholders) without detrimentally impacting on the value of the company.\nIn outline terms, free cash flow to the firm (FCFF) is:\nFCFF = Excess of operating cash flow (excluding interest payments) over capital expenditure\nInterest payments are removed here as they are paid to one of those providers of finance, the bondholders.\nNow, if CFO is the net cash flow from operations, then:\nOperating cash flows excluding interest = CFO + Interest (1 \u2013 Tax rate)\nNote, we add back the after-tax impact of interest as, with interest being tax allowable, this shows how much additional cash would be available were no interest payable. Given this, we can now say:\nFCFF = CFO + Interest (1 \u2013 Tax rate) \u2013 FCInv\nWhere FCInv is the capital expenditures necessary to maintain the company\u2019s operations.\nAs we saw above, however, we can reconcile from net income (NI) to the free cash flow from operations (CFO) by adjusting for any non-cash charges (NCC) and for any working capital increases/investment (WCInv), the relationship being:\nCFO = NI + NCC \u2013 WCInv\nThat is, we add back non-cash charges such as depreciation and we deduct any increases in working capital. If we now substitute this in the previous formula we get:\nFCFF = NI + NCC \u2013 WCInv + Interest (1 \u2013 Tax rate) \u2013 FCInv\nFree cash flow to equity (FCFE)\nWhile free cash flow to the firm represents funds that can be freely distributed to all of the company\u2019s investors (shareholders and bondholders) without detrimentally impacting on the value of the company, free cash flow to equity represents funds that can be freely distributed to common stockholders without detrimentally impacting on the company, i.e. the free cash flow after servicing any necessary debt payments (interest and principal payments). Thus:\nFCFE = FCFF \u2013 Interest (1 \u2013 Tax rate) \u2013 Net debt repayment\nWhich, based on what we saw above, may also be expressed as:\nFCFE = NI + NCC \u2013 WCInv \u2013 FCInv \u2013 Net debt repayment\nor as:\nFCFE = CFO \u2013 FCInv \u2013 Net debt repayment\nNote that the final term ( \u2013 Net debt repayment) assumes that debt repayments exceed receipts of borrowed funds, where receipts of borrowed funds exceed debt repayments this final term is replaced by + Net borrowing in all the above relationships.\nCash flow ratios\nIn addition to using the ratios in question practice, you will find our cash flow ratios tutorial provides a useful summary of why the ratios below are useful for analysts: https://bcove.video/2ko7mRN.\nLOS 7.26i Calculate and interpret free cash flow to the firm, free cash flow to equity, and performance and coverage cash flow ratios.\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nExam focus\nIn both the morning and afternoon sessions you will often find a number of questions testing the accounting classification differences between US GAAP and IFRS so easy marks can be gained if your knowledge is sound.\nThere are several learning-outcome statements in this reading on the calculation and interpretation of the direct and indirect methods of presenting cash from operations. Questions in the exam can be either written or calculation-based but will tend to focus on calculating CFO, CFI or CFF. It is worth spending a lot of time practicing as many questions on this topic as possible.\nAlthough the coverage of free cash at Level I is very brief, it is an important concept at Level II so is worth tackling now.\nIt is important that you can recall what the various cash flow ratios in reading 26 measure since this is a common area from which examination questions are derived.\n\u00a0\nThe Study Guides and other exam prep information available on Investopedia are for informational purposes only.

Rather, they want to know whether they should be an investor in the future.\nBefore starting any financial analysis we must clarify the:\n\nPurpose of the analysis: This may be for investment advice, valuation as a takeover target, credit analysis by a lender, etc. each of whom has a slightly different emphasis/concern.\n\n\nLevel of detail required: To achieve the identified purpose we need to assess the level of detail we will require in the information we wish to use, and the explanations we may need to correctly understand that information.\n\n\nAvailable data: We then need to determine the potential sources of information that we will have access to. Will this simply be published data or will we have access to the company and its internal information and commentary.\n\n\nFactors influencing the analysis: Who we are conducting the analysis for and why we are conducting the analysis are our major considerations since they identify our primary emphasis/concern. If it is for the company itself, that will probably influence the availability of information and associated explanations, although we should always be conscious of the potential for bias in any explanations or commentary received.\n\n\nAnalytical limitations: We are unlikely to be able to get all of the information and explanations that we may ideally require.\u00a0Hence, there will invariably be limitations in our analysis leading to caveats in our conclusions.\n\nHaving clarified these issues we need to consider what tools we wish to use, such as ratios, common-size statements, etc. Analysts must select the most suitable ratios and techniques to satisfy their analysis objectives. The framework below may serve as a useful guide. We must, however, bear in mind that any ratio itself is only a tool that reveals information regarding the past, and that effective analysis is about finding explanations for what we have seen in the past and drawing implications for the future.\nFinancial analysis process\nThe financial analysis process can conveniently be broken down into a number of phases during which we will access different sources of information and have different output objectives as follows:\n\n\u00a0\nPurpose and limitation of ratio analysis\nLOS 7.27a Describe tools and techniques used in financial analysis, including their uses and limitations.\nIntroduction\nPurpose: Ratios are a useful means of expressing the relationships within financial accounts\u00a0and may be used as a convenient indicator of an aspect of a company\u2019s performance or position.\nAdvantages: Ratios are typically easily understood by users. And, by being presented as percentages or multiples, they reduce the effect of size differences, enhancing comparability between companies of different sizes.\nConsiderations: There are, however, some very important considerations when calculating and using ratios:\n\nRelevance: Not all ratios are relevant to a particular analysis exercise and the analyst should only utilize those that are relevant.\n\n\nComparative: In practice, a ratio in isolation is meaningless; its value comes from comparing it to the same ratio for previous years or for competitors, etc. to see whether/how it may have changed and consider the implications of this for the future.\n\n\nMatching like-for-like: This has a number of aspects that may arise in different circumstances:\u00a0\nAccounting periods: We should ideally be comparing common accounting periods, especially if we are analyzing periods shorter than one year in businesses whose trade is seasonal. This tends to be less relevant when analyzing annual statements.\u00a0However, even then the precise start and end dates of the period may be important if, say, there has been a change in economic circumstances.\u00a0\nAccounting policies: When comparing two different companies, ratios may be distorted by any difference in accounting policies, such as the inventory valuation method applied or the depreciation method or term, and a meaningful comparison may involve adjusting the accounts of one company applying the policies of the other.\nRatios comparing balance sheet and income statement figures: Matching is particularly important for ratios that compare income-statement figures to balance-sheet figures.\n\nThe income statement provides details of revenues and profits throughout the entire year, whereas the balance sheet provides details of\u00a0assets and liabilities at the year end, figures that may not be representative of the assets and liabilities held throughout the year. This will be especially true if there have been major acquisitions or disposals during the year or major raising or repayment of finance.\nWe may ideally wish to use a weighted average balance sheet figure (as we do when calculating the earnings-per-share figure). However, the information to do this is unlikely to be available. Consequently, great care needs to be taken with these ratios, in particular to ensure the ratio is both useful and meaningful.\n\nInterpretation of the figures: A ratio itself is simply a tool that helps us identify what has occurred in the company or what position it is in, i.e. what we have seen. This, however, is simply the start of the analysis process. We must then consider possible causes for any changes, the potential for distortions in the figures, the limitations of our analysis, and, ultimately, the implications for the future. In practice, the computation of a ratio is just a very small part of the whole analysis exercise; the interpretation is of far more significance.\n\nMany of these practical considerations will not be relevant in the exam where you may simply be asked to calculate a ratio or draw some very basic conclusions.\u00a0However, any real-world practical application would need to address all of the above and more.\nValue of ratio analysis\nIrrespective of these considerations, ratios help provide an insight into the:\n\nmicroeconomic relationships within a firm:\u00a0such as its revenues, cost structure, profitability etc.\n\n\npotential returns and risks:\u00a0the returns available to, or risks faced by, investors or trading partners\n\n\nfirm\u2019s financial flexibility:\u00a0the ability of the firm, perhaps through cash flow generation, to expand through acquisition or to respond to economic shocks\n\n\nmanagement performance:\u00a0management\u2019s ability to effectively utilize the resources available to them.\n\nLimitations\nAlthough it may be very easy to calculate a ratio, the results may not be very useful because of:\n\nlike-for-like: any lack of homogeneity of a company\u2019s operating activities resulting in an inability to match like-for-like, particularly when comparing companies that use different accounting methods\n\n\njudgment: the need to use judgment, perhaps in making adjustments for accounting policy differences or in the interpretation of the calculated ratios\n\n\ninterpretation: the need to interpret any findings and determine if the results are consistent with other aspects of the analysis.\n\nCommon-size financial statements\nLOS 7.25g Convert balance sheets to common-size balance sheets and interpret the common-size balance sheets.\nLOS 7.27a Describe tools and techniques used in financial analysis, including their uses and limitations.\nIntroduction\nIt is often very difficult to compare two different companies if they are of a substantially different scale.\u00a0One way of tackling this, however,\u00a0is to undertake a common-size analysis. The balance sheet, income statement and cash flow statement can all be analyzed on a common size basis in which:\n\nBalance sheet: Each asset, liability, and equity item is expressed as a percentage of total assets by using the following formula.\n\n\n\nIncome statement: Each income and expense line item is expressed as a percentage of net revenues by using the following formula.\n\n\n\nCash flow statement: Two common alternative approaches using similar formulae to:\nExpress each cash flow line item as a percentage of total inflows (outflows).\nExpress each cash flow line item as a percentage of net revenue.\n\nBy considering companies on a common size basis we can compare companies of different sizes to look for similarities, and we can investigate whether/how/why they are different and what the implications of any difference may be.\nIllustration\nWe are trying to compare two companies, Company A and Company B, whose balance sheets are given below.\n\nAs we can see, these are two substantially differently sized companies, making it very difficult to undertake a direct comparison based on these dollar figures.\nIf, however, we present the information on a common size basis we find the following.\n\nAs we can now easily see when we look at the common sites percentage figures, the structure of the assets is identical in the two companies, they appear to be trading in an identical manner despite their difference in scale.\nPurpose of common size statements\nA common-size balance sheet helps the analyst to identify the following:\n\nComposition: It highlights the composition of the balance sheet.\n\n\nComparison to prior years: It facilitates comparison between different time periods in a growing company that helps to highlight changes in the balance sheet composition.\n\n\nComparison to competitors: It facilitates comparison between different companies of different sizes, or the comparison to overall industry averages.\n\nA common-size income statement helps the analyst to identify the following:\n\nProfitability: It highlights the proportionate cost structure and profit margins.\n\n\nBusiness mix: Revenue can be analyzed among its different sources to identify the business mix.\n\n\nComparison to prior years: It facilitates comparison between different time periods, highlighting any changes in the cost structure, profitability or business mix.\n\n\nComparison to competitors: It facilitates comparison between different companies of different sizes, or the comparison to overall industry averages.\n\nCross-sectional and trend analysis\nCross-sectional analysis\nDefinition: Where we compare a specific ratio between two companies or several companies in the same industry/sector, a process that may be done on a common size basis. We should note that there is little point in comparing companies in different sectors that trade in entirely different ways. For example, the ratios for a high-growth high-tech company are likely to be markedly different from those of a utility company.\nTrend analysis\nTrend analysis seeks to identify trends in ratios over an extended period (typically 5 to 10 years) that may be useful to the analyst for forecasting purposes. Trends may, for example, highlight growing, stable or declining profitability, liquidity, leverage, etc.\nAs well as seeking to identify trends, the analyst should also look for discontinuities in trends, i.e. sudden changes in ratios that may identify significant business changes that need to be incorporated within the analysis.\nUse of graphics as an analytical tool\nGraphs are a highly visual and, typically, easy to understand tool that are used to:\n\nOverview: Provide a visual overview of trends in a business.\n\n\nChanges: Highlight changes in significant aspects of the business.\n\n\nComparison: Facilitate the comparison of performance and financial structure over time.\n\n\nConclusions: Help communicate an analyst\u2019s conclusions.\n\nVarious types of graphs may be used, including:\n\nPie graphs: These are useful for communicating the composition of total values (e.g. the composition of current assets).\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nLine graphs: These are useful for focusing on the change in a value or ratio for a limited number of items over a longer time period (e.g. changes in the composition of current assets over time).\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nStacked column graph: These are useful when the composition, values\u00a0and change are all important.\n\n\n\u00a0\nClassification of ratios\nLOS 7.27b Classify, calculate\u00a0and interpret activity, liquidity, solvency, profitability\u00a0and valuation ratios.\nLOS 7.27c Describe the relationships among ratios and evaluate a company using ratio analysis.\nRatios may be classified under the following headings:\n\nActivity: Measures how efficiently a company performs its day-to-day tasks.\n\n\nLiquidity: Measures the company\u2019s ability to pay short-term obligations.\n\n\nSolvency: Measures the company\u2019s ability to pay long-term obligations.\n\n\nProfitability: Measures the company\u2019s ability to generate profitable sales from its resources.\n\n\nValuation: Measures the value of an asset or the earnings associated with ownership of a share.\n\n\u00a0\nThe Study Guides and other exam prep information available on Investopedia are for informational purposes only.

However, if the cost of goods sold is not provided we may alternatively use the purchases figure for the inventory turnover, and if the purchases figure is not provided we may use the cost-of-goods-sold figure for the payables turnover.\n2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As these ratios compare income-statement figures to balance-sheet figures we should ideally use the weighted average inventory, receivables and payables for each year in question. This information is rarely available, although we may be able to approximate it in a fairly stable business by using the average inventory, receivables and payables (requiring opening and closing values for each year). If, however, this information is not available we will need to simply use year-end figures and be aware of the distortion that this may bring.\nThese ratios are multiples, for example inventory turnover may be 6\u00d7. Thinking about this logically, what this would mean is that we sell the average item of inventory within two months, hence we sell six lots of inventory in a year.\nTime-based ratios\nMany analysts prefer to express this turnover in terms of the time taken to sell an average unit of inventory or to pay or recover the cash, rather than as a multiple. Hence, rather than reporting inventory turnover or receivables turnover we may report the inventory-processing period (the days of inventory on hand (DOH)), the payables-payment period and the receivables-collection period (days of sales outstanding (DSO)) that are effectively the inverse of the above ratios and are calculated as follows.\n\nCash conversion cycle\nThe days of inventory on hand gives us the time taken to sell the average unit of inventory, the days of sales outstanding gives the average credit period taken by customers\u00a0and the number of days of payables gives the average credit period the company is taking from its suppliers. These figures are all very important in a company\u2019s cash conversion cycle.\nA company\u2019s cash conversion cycle describes the difference between when a company must pay for its goods and when it receives cash from selling those goods and is best illustrated by an example. You will also find the tutorial below useful as a means of illustrating the cash conversion cycle: https://bcove.video/2jSrXK0.\nSuppose that a company has days of inventory on hand of 10 days, its days of sales outstanding is 45 days, and its number of days of payables is 30 days. If we consider this on a timeline we would see the following.\n\nThis may be described as an equation as follows:\nCash conversion cycle = DOH + DSO \u2013 Number of days of payables\nIn this example that is:\nCash conversion cycle = 10 + 45 \u2013 30 = 25 days\nThe cash conversion cycle for a business is the time between when it must pay cash out for the goods it has bought and when it will receive the cash in from selling those goods, a measure that varies significantly between sectors. In this example, the business must be able to finance this 25-day gap between receipts and payments if it wishes to operate in this sector and must have sufficient working capital to allow it to do so.\nAs we have noted, however, this cash conversion cycle varies significantly between sectors. For example, supermarkets sell their average item of stock within, say, 10 days, all sales being cash sales. Given their financial strength, supermarkets may demand a credit term from their suppliers of, say, 60 days, giving them a cash conversion cycle of:\nCash conversion cycle = 10 + 0 \u2013 60 = \u201350 days\nEffectively, therefore, the supermarket is getting a 50-day interest-free loan from their suppliers that they will never need to repay as long as they continue to trade.\nWhat this example demonstrates is that a ratio or analysis measure in isolation is meaningless and there is no single value for any ratio or measure that would be regarded as good or bad. Activity ratios will vary between sectors based on their cash conversion cycles.\nActivity ratios example\nLOS 7.27b Classify, calculate, and interpret activity, liquidity, solvency, profitability, and valuation ratios.\nLOS 7.27c Describe the relationships among ratios and evaluate a company using ratio analysis.\nExample\nCalculate inventory turnover, receivables turnover, payables turnover and the cash conversion cycle for the following two businesses. Identify which is most likely to be a book publisher and which is most likely to be a training firm.\n\nSolution\nTurnover ratios\n\nCash conversion cycle\nThis cash conversion cycle can most conveniently be calculated using:\n\u00a0\n\nBased on this, for each business we can calculate the cash conversion cycle:\nBusiness 1 = 52.7 + 121.7 \u2013 33.2 = 141.2 days\nCash conversion cycle = DOH + DSO \u2013 Number of days of payables\nas:\nBusiness 2 = 7.6 + 30.4 \u2013 121.7 = \u201383.7 days\nBusiness type\nGiven this data, Business 1 is most likely to be the book publisher, as book publishers tend to have significant inventories and must offer significant credit terms, particularly to retailers who are commercially very strong, such as Amazon.\nIn contrast, training providers do not tend to hold significant inventories and do not offer significant credit terms.\u00a0Indeed they are frequently paid in advance for courses, resulting in the negative cash conversion cycle seen in Business 2.\nOperational activity ratios\nLOS 7.27b Classify, calculate\u00a0and interpret activity, liquidity, solvency, profitability, and valuation ratios.\nLOS 7.27c Describe the relationships among ratios and evaluate a company using ratio analysis.\nOperational activity ratios are another class of activity ratio that seeks to measure how efficiently a company utilizes its resources by the use of the following standard turnover ratios.\n\nFor example, if a business had a fixed asset turnover of 4\u00d7 then for every $1 of fixed assets it holds it will generate $4 of revenue each year.\nLiquidity ratios\nLOS 7.27b Classify, calculate, and interpret activity, liquidity, solvency, profitability, and valuation ratios.\nLOS 7.27c Describe the relationships among ratios and evaluate a company using ratio analysis.\nLiquidity ratios measure the company\u2019s ability to pay its short-term obligations, i.e. the debts that are payable within the next 12 months.\nThe three primary liquidity ratios compare the level of current assets to the level of current liabilities, considering different levels of liquidity in those current assets, the ratios being:\n\nCommenting briefly on each of these:\n\nCurrent ratio: The current ratio compares all current assets (cash, marketable securities, receivables and inventory) to current liabilities.\n\n\nQuick ratio: The quick ratio compares just the more liquid current assets (cash, marketable securities and receivables) and disregards the inventories that may, in many businesses, be hard to realize as rapidly as cash. The numerator (top line) for this ratio may alternatively be calculated as: Current assets \u2013 Inventories.\n\n\nCash ratio: The cash ratio just considers the immediately realizable current assets, disregarding any current assets with an extended recovery period. The numerator (top line) for this ratio may alternatively be calculated as: Current assets \u2013 Inventories \u2013 Receivables.\n\nRemember that a ratio in isolation is meaningless and there is no single value for any of these ratios that would be regarded as good or bad. What liquidity ratios are suitable for a business will vary between sectors based on their cash conversion cycles:\nCash conversion cycle = DOH + DSO \u2013 Payable days\nThe final ratio to consider is the defensive interval ratio which shows how long the company could survive if its market were to suddenly collapse and it needed to meet its day-to-day cash expenditure from its existing cash, marketable securities and receivables.\n\nThe defensive interval ratio shows the number of days the business would have to establish a new market in this disaster scenario.\n\u00a0\nThe Study Guides and other exam prep information available on Investopedia are for informational purposes only.

One of the important distinctions between equity and debt is that debt represents a fixed cost to the business, i.e. debt payments (interest and principal) must be made when they fall due. If a company\u2019s operating profits are low it can cut the dividend paid to shareholders;\u00a0it cannot cut the interest paid to debtholders.\nThe other side of this coin, however, is that if a company\u2019s operating profits rise, the entire profit increase will be passed on to the shareholders since the debtholders are only entitled to the interest payable on that debt and do not participate further in the profits of the business.\nHence, from the shareholders\u2019 point of view, debt tends to amplify the volatility of the business\u2019s operating profits, with a small change in operating profits potentially resulting in a large change in equity returns (both return increases and decreases).\nOne way to assess the likely impact is to determine the percentage change in EBT (from which equity returns are financed) and the percentage change in EBIT. If we find that the percentage increase in EBT exceeds the percentage increase in EBIT we will experience an increase in returns to equity holders.\nIn addition to amplifying any return volatility, a higher level of debt has two further (potentially adverse) consequences, specifically increased leverage:\n\nIncreases the risk of default: The likelihood of being unable to pay interest and/or principal when they fall due increases as debt levels and interest costs rise.\n\n\nHigher borrowing costs: As default risk rises, lenders will demand a higher return in order to provide finance, particularly at very high levels of leverage, potentially making debt a very expensive source of financing.\n\nA company\u2019s relative solvency is fundamental to its valuation, the valuation of its debt securities and its creditworthiness, and may provide an insight into the company\u2019s future business prospects. It also often signals management\u2019s belief in the company\u2019s future, the concept of \"signaling\" being considered in the corporate finance study sessions (Study Sessions 10 and 11).\nSolvency debt ratios\nLOS 7.27b Classify, calculate\u00a0and interpret activity, liquidity, solvency, profitability\u00a0and valuation ratios.\nLOS 7.27c Describe the relationships among ratios and evaluate a company using ratio analysis.\nThe solvency debt ratios consider and compare certain balance sheet figures, the level of debt, assets and equity. They are primarily considering the ability of the business to repay any debt principal, the main ratios being:\n\nThe debt-to-equity ratio is probably the most commonly quoted solvency ratio. However, as we shall see, the financial leverage ratio is very important when we consider the return-on-equity ratio.\nGenerally speaking, the higher the level of any of these ratios, the greater the financial risk. However, we should, as ever, observe\u00a0that a ratio in isolation is meaningless and there is no single value for any of these ratios that would be regarded as good or bad. What is suitable for any business will depend on its circumstances and the sectors it operates within.\nFor example, utility companies (water suppliers or electricity generators) tend to have very stable earnings and cash flows with low volatility and can, therefore, sustain very high levels of leverage. In contrast, new small high-tech companies tend to have highly volatile earnings and should, therefore, be advised to have very low (or even no) leverage.\nFor the purposes of the exam we should assume that a higher ratio implies greater financial risk.\u00a0However, in practice, we would need to understand why the debt has increased and what the implications are for the future. For example, if a business has raised significant debt shortly before the end of the year in order to take over a competitor in the following year, this additional debt and leverage may actually have positive implications.\nSolvency coverage ratios\nLOS 7.27b Classify, calculate\u00a0and interpret activity, liquidity, solvency, profitability, and valuation ratios.\nLOS 7.27c Describe the relationships among ratios and evaluate a company using ratio analysis.\nThe solvency coverage ratios compare certain income statement figures and are primarily considering the ability of the business to service its interest obligations. They show how many times the interest is covered by the business\u2019s earnings before interest and tax, the primary ratio being:\n\nGenerally, this is calculated based on income statement figures, however it may alternatively be calculated based on cash flow figures, since ultimately the interest must be paid as cash.\nOne potential problem with this ratio is that the interest payments may be distorted by accounting choices, particularly where interest is capitalized or in the context of operating lease payments. An alternative measure that may improve comparability between companies that make these different accounting choices is the fixed charge cover ratio.\n\nGenerally speaking, the higher the ratio, the safer the interest payment. For example, if the interest cover was 4\u00d7, the business could afford its EBIT to fall to \u00bc of its current level and still service the interest payments, whereas if the interest cover was 1\u00d7 the company could not afford any fall in profits.\nAs ever, however, we must remember there is no single value for any ratio that would be regarded as good or bad. In practice, we would need to consider what is suitable for that particular type of business and, where there has been a change, understand the reason for that change and the implication it has for the future.\nOnce more, what is suitable for any business will depend on the sectors it operates within and the inherent volatility of its earnings. As a general comment, however, a business with more volatile earnings should aim to have a higher cover level than a business whose earnings are less volatile.\n\u00a0\nThe Study Guides and other exam prep information available on Investopedia are for informational purposes only.

As these ratios compare income statement figures to balance sheet figures they should ideally use weighted average balance sheet figures to achieve a like-for-like comparison.

Successful businesses tend to have either low margins and a high asset turnover (such as supermarkets) or high margins and low asset turnover (such as jewelers or luxury goods retailers).\nIncreasing ROA\nAs we have seen, the return on assets is a function of net profit margins and asset turnover, hence the return on assets can be increased by either, or by a combination of:\n\nIncreased margins: These can be increased by either increasing revenue or reducing costs.\n\n\nIncreased asset turnover: This can be increased by either increasing revenue or reducing average total assets, requiring the more efficient use of those assets.\n\n\u00a0\nThe Study Guides and other exam prep information available on Investopedia are for informational purposes only.

Since: Return on equity (ROE) = Return on assets (ROA) \u00d7 Financial leverage, what we can conclude is that despite decreasing profit margins, the return on equity has expanded over the three years due to the increased level of leverage. The increase in leverage has more than offset the decline in margins, resulting in a rising ROE.\nExtended DuPont analysis\nLOS 7.27d Demonstrate the application of the DuPont analysis of return on equity, and calculate and interpret the effects of changes in its components.\nThe extended (5 stage) DuPont method breaks down the first factor in the three-stage model [the net (after tax) profit margin]\u00a0even further into the:\n\nEBIT margin: The margin before interest and tax.\n\n\nInterest burden: The earnings after interest but before tax (EBT) as a proportion of EBIT reflecting the interest burden faced by the company.\n\n\nTax burden: The earnings after tax (net income or EAT) as a proportion of the earnings before tax (EBT) reflecting the tax burden faced by the company.\n\nAs follows:\n\nHence, re-ordering these three most recent terms, the five-stage DuPont method states:\nROE = EBIT margin \u00d7 Interest burden \u00d7 Tax burden \u00d7 Asset turnover \u00d7 Financial leverage\nBefore moving on, we should examine the meaning of the tax and interest-burden ratios. Looking at the interest-burden ratio, if there is no interest this ratio above would be 1 as EBT = EBIT, however as the level of interest increases this ratio will fall below 1. Similarly, when there is no tax, the tax burden ratio above will be 1 as EAT = EBT, however as the level of tax increases this ratio will, again, fall below 1. This is important to appreciate, as to maximize the net profit margin (and hence the return on equity (ROE)) we must maximize each of these input components, which means minimizing interest and minimizing tax.\nIncreasing ROE\nBased on this more complete analysis, we can see that the return of equity can be increased by any, or a combination of:\n\nIncreased operating margins: Margins based on EBIT that can be increased by either increasing revenue or reducing operating costs.\n\n\nReducing the interest burden: Minimizing interest as explained above.\n\n\nReducing the tax burden: Minimizing tax as explained above.\n\n\nIncreased asset turnover: This can be increased by either increasing revenue or reducing average total assets, requiring the more efficient use of those assets.\n\n\nIncreased leverage: This can be increased by either increasing debt or reducing equity, perhaps through repurchasing equity.\n\nSegment analysis\nLOS 7.27f Explain the requirements for segment reporting, and calculate and interpret segment ratios.\nFinancial statements are required to show the revenues and profits of the business both in aggregate terms and by business segment. In outline, a business segment is a separate material business operation (a division, subsidiary or discrete\u00a0activity) that may be identifiable on either an operational or geographical basis. A more formal definition of a segment is: A component of a company:\n\nOperations: That engages in activities that generate revenues and create expenses.\n\n\nMateriality: Whose results are regularly reviewed by the company\u2019s senior management.\n\n\nSeparate: For which discrete\u00a0financial information is available.\n\nA segment may be viewed as a business within a business, and we may wish to assess the profitability, liquidity, leverage, etc. of each segment in much the same way as we assess the business overall, i.e. through assessing margins, asset turnover, ROA, etc.\nThus, we will be considering the following ratios:\n\n\u00a0\nThe Study Guides and other exam prep information available on Investopedia are for informational purposes only.

Credit analysis is the evaluation of this credit risk and may relate to an individual transaction or to a borrower\u2019s overall creditworthiness.\nThe general approach of most businesses when undertaking the credit analysis of an individual or another business is to use credit ratings that are prepared by the major credit rating agencies, such as S&P, Moody\u2019s or Fitch, but how do these rating agencies analyze credit risk?\nTypically, the credit rating agency will:\n\nVisit the company: The agencies will meet with management, and perhaps tour the major facilities to try to get an understanding and appreciation of the business, how it works, and how it is run.\n\n\nConsider relevant factors: This may require the use of certain ratios, some of which we have seen already, the primary factors typically being:\nBusiness risk: The risks faced by the business based on how it is trading and any potential liquidity issues that may arise.\nFinancial risk: The risk faced by the business based on how it is financed and any potential leverage issues that may arise.\nQuality of management: Evaluate the quality of management, perhaps by considering activity and profitability ratios.\n\nCredit ratios\nLOS 7.27e Calculate and interpret ratios used in equity analysis and credit analysis.\nRatios that may commonly be applied in determining the credit risk include the following:\n\n*Capital employed = Equity (including minority interest) + Total debt + Non-current deferred taxes\nForecasting techniques\nLOS 7.27g Describe how ratio analysis and other techniques can be used to model and forecast earnings.\nThe ultimate aim of any analysis is to get an idea of the future prospects of the company. Analysts often need to make a forecast of expected future financial performance.\nThe start of any forecast will be to examine the economic environment that the business will be operating within through considering the likely state of the economy as a whole, and the likely performance of the company\u2019s industry/sector within that economy. The analyst will then look at the company itself, perhaps with the help of common-size statements and ratio analysis, to try to determine how they believe this business will perform within its sector.\nAlthough objective tools, such as ratios, may be used, forecasting itself is not an objective exercise and the analyst\u2019s judgment is integral to this process. An analyst can create an \"earnings model\"\u00a0to try to forecast future performance [covered in the Corporate Finance study session (Study Sessions 10 and 11)]. However, a lot of judgment is required in determining the correct inputs to this model.\nAnalysts may also wish to determine the reasonableness or otherwise of any forecast they have prepared, which they\u00a0may be able to do through:\n\nSensitivity analysis: Sensitivity analysis shows the range of outcomes that may arise if a specific assumption is changed, hence the sensitivity of the forecast to a potential error in that assumption.\n\n\nScenario analysis: Scenario analysis identifies key changes in the financial performance that result from economic events. The forecast may be prepared in light of a variety of potential economic scenarios to establish a range of future performance possibilities.\n\n\nSimulation: Simulation involves running a very large number of computer-generated assumptions and scenarios based on an analysis of their probabilities to try to paint as complete a picture as possible of the potential range of future performance possibilities.\n\nExam focus\nAlthough it is easy to get overwhelmed by the number of ratios and formulas in this reading, it is important to focus on what each type of ratio tells you (activity, liquidity, solvency, profitability and valuation) how to calculate them and when to use them. You will find a number of ratio-based questions in both the morning and afternoon papers based on a comparison of ratios.\nAnother common area for exam questions relates to the three main analysis techniques, i.e. sensitivity analysis, scenario analysis and simulation. You need to be able to explain how each of these techniques is used. Exam questions on this area often set out information about an analysis an individual is undertaking and then ask you to identify what kind of analysis this would be.\nThe Study Guides and other exam prep information available on Investopedia are for informational purposes only.

They allow analysts to quickly look through a company's financial statements and identify trends and anomalies. Ratios can be classified in terms of the information they provide to the reader. \n\nThere are four classifications of financial ratios:\n\n\nInternal liquidity - The ratios used in this classification were developed to analyze and determine a company's financial ability to meet short-term liabilities.\n\nOperating performance - The ratios used in this classification were developed to analyze and determine how well management operates a company. The ratios found in this classification can be divided into 'operating profitability' and 'operating efficiency'. Operating profitability relates the company's overall profitability, and operating efficiency reveals if the company's assets were utilized efficiently. \n\nRisk profile - The ratios found in this classification can be divided into 'business risk' and 'financial risk'. Business risk relates the company's income variance, i.e. the risk of not generating consistent cash flows over time. Financial risk is the risk that relates to the company's financial structure, i.e. use of debt. \n\nGrowth potential - The ratios used in this classification are useful to stockholders and creditors as it allows the stockholders to determine what the company is worth, and allows creditors to estimate the company's ability to pay its existing debt and evaluate their additional debt applications, if any.\n\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_150", "text": "\n        1.

Receivable Turnover Ratio\r\nThis ratio provides an indicator of the effectiveness of a company's credit policy. The high receivable turnover will indicate that the company collects its dues from its customers quickly. If this ratio is too high compared to the industry, this may indicate that the company does not offer its clients a long enough credit facility, and as a result may be losing sales. A decreasing receivable-turnover ratio may indicate that the company is having difficulties collecting cash from customers, and may be a sign that sales are perhaps overstated.\n\nFormula 7.7\n\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\tReceivable turnover = net annual sales\r\n\t\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0average receivables\n\r\n\t\t\t\tWhere:\r\n\t\t\t\tAverage receivables = (previously reported account receivable + current account receivables)/2\n\n\n\n\r\n6.

Inventory Turnover Ratio\r\nThis ratio provides an indication of how efficiently the company's inventory is utilized by management. A high inventory ratio is an indicator that the company sells its inventory rapidly and that the inventory does not languish, which may mean there is less risk that the inventory reported has decreased in value. Too high a ratio could indicate a level of inventory that is too low, perhaps resulting in frequent shortages of stock and the potential of losing customers. It could also indicate inadequate production levels for meeting customer demand.\n\nFormula 7.9\n\n\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\tInventory turnover = cost of goods sold\r\n\t\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 average inventory\n\r\n\t\t\t\tWhere:\r\n\t\t\t\tAverage inventory = (previously reported inventory + current inventory)/2\n\n\n\n\r\n8.

There is a simple method and more complex method:\n\nI. Simple Method\nThe following four ratios represent the simple method of business risk calculations. Business risk is the risk of a company making less money, or worse, losing money if sales decrease. In the declining-sales environment, a company would lose money mainly because of its fixed costs. If a company only incurred variable costs, it would never have negative earnings. Unfortunately, all businesses have a component of fixed costs. Understanding a company's fixed-cost structure is crucial in the determination of its business risk. One of the main ratios used to evaluate business risk is the contribution margin ratio.\n\n1. Contribution Margin Ratio\nThis ratio indicates the incremental profit resulting from a given dollar change of sales. If a company's contribution ratio is 20%, then a $50,000 decline in sales will result in a $10,000 decline in profits.\n\nFormula 7.28\n\n\n\n\nContribution margin ratio = contribution\u00a0\r\n\t\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0sales\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0= 1 - (variable cost / sales)\n\n\n\n\n2. Operation Leverage Effect (OLE) \nThe operating leverage ratio is used to estimate the percentage change in income and return on assets for a given percentage change in sales volume. Return on sales is the same as return on assets.\n\r\nIf a company has an OLE greater than 1, then operating leverage exists. If OLE is equal to 1 then all costs are variable, so a 10% increase in sales will increase the company's ROA by 10%. \n\nFormula 7.29\n\n\n\n\nOperation leverage effect = contribution margin ratio\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0return on sales (ROS)\n\r\n\t\t\t\tWhere:\nROS = Percentage change in income (ROA) = OLE\u00a0x % change in sales\n\n\n\n\n3. Financial Leverage Effect (FLE)\nCompanies that use debt to finance their operations, thus creating a financial leverage effect and increasing the return to stockholders, represent an additional business risk if revenues vary. The financial leverage effect is used to quantify the effect of leverage within a company.\n\nFormula 7.30\n\n\n\n\nFinancial leverage effect = operating income\u00a0\r\n\t\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0net income\n\n\n\n\nIf a company has an FLE of 1.33, an increase of 50% in operating income would result in a 67% shift in net income.\n\n4. Total Leverage Effect (TLE)\nBy combining the OLE and FLE, we get the total leverage effect (TLE), which is defined as:\n\nFormula 7.31\n\n\n\n\nTotal leverage effect = OLE\u00a0x FLE\n\n\n\n\nIn our previous example, sales increased by $50,000, the OLE was 20% and FLE was 1.33. The total leverage effect would be $13,333, i.e. net income would increase by $13,333 for every $50,000 in increased sales.\n\nII. Complex Method\nBusiness risk can be analyzed by simply looking at variations in sales and operating income (EBIT) over time. A more structured approach is to use some statistics. One common method is to gather a date set that's large enough (five to 10 years) to calculate the coefficient of variation. \n\nWith this approach: \n\n- Business risk = standard deviation of operating income / mean of operating income\n- Sales variability = standard deviation of sales / sales mean\n- Another source of variability of operating income is the difference between fixed and variable cost. This is referred to as \"operating leverage\". A company with a large variable structure is less likely to create a loss if revenues decline. The calculation of variability of operating income is complex and beyond CFA level 1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLook Out!\n\n\n\n\nNote that it is unlikely that the exam will ask you to calculate any ratios relating to business risk that utilize statistics. \n\n\n\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_155", "text": "\n\nFinancial Risk - This is risk related to the company's financial structure.\n\nI.

Lines of business are often broken down into geographical segments, when the size or type of business differentiates them from other business lines.\r\nSince many segments have different risk profiles, they should be analyzed and valued separately from other parts of the business. Conducting ratio analysis, specifically profit margins, return on assets and other profitability measures can give analysts insight into how the segment affects overall financial performance. Both U.S. GAAP and IFRS require companies to report specific segment data, which is only a subset of the overall reporting requirements.\n\nRatio Analysis\n\r\nRatio analysis can be used to estimate future performance and allows analysts to create pro forma financial statements. Here is one example of how to estimate the future earnings potential of a firm. An analyst can first create a common-size income statement by dividing all accounting items by total sales. Using forecast assumptions the analyst then determines the amount of future sales. By multiplying the common-size percentages by the new sales amount, the analyst prepares a pro forma income statement that estimates the future earnings potential based on the expectations of future sales.\n\r\nBy using a range of values from the common-size statement and using a range of values for sales, the analyst can conduct a sensitivity analysis for each of the accounting items, such as cost of goods sold (COGS), profit margin and net income, to see how sensitive they are to changes in the amount of sales.\n\r\nBy understanding how each of these items correlate to the changes in sales, an analyst can create a function that provides output for these measures for any potential sales amount in the future. Using this function an analyst can conduct scenario analysis by choosing assumptions for different market situations and create for example a base case, upside and downside scenario.\n\r\nScenario analysis gives analysts an idea of the risks involved in operating a firm under different economic situations. To create an even more detailed probability distribution of potential values and risk, some analysts will conduct simulations that use a computer to produce many potential scenarios\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_157", "text": "\n\nDuPont System\nA system of analysis has been developed that focuses the attention on all three critical elements of the financial condition of a company: the operating management, management of assets and the capital structure.

For example, when ROE is high because the equity multiplier is high, this means that high returns are really coming from overuse of debt, which can spell trouble. \n\nIf two companies have the same ROE, but the first is well managed (high net-profit margin) and managed assets efficiently (high asset turnover) but has a low equity multiplier compared to the other company, then an investor is better off investing in the first company, because the capital structure can be changed easily (increase use of debt), but changing management is difficult. \n\nMore Useful Dupont Formula Manipulations\nThe DuPont formula can be expanded even further, thus giving the analyst more information.\n\nFormula 7.43\n\n\n\n\nROE = (net income / sales) * (sales / assets) * (assets / equity)\n\nIf in a third instance we substituted net income for EBT * (1-tax rate), we get:\n\nROE =(EBT/sales) * (sales / assets) * (assets / equity)* (1-tax rate)\n\n\n\n\nFormula 7.44\n\n\n\n\nROE = (net income / sales) * (sales / assets) * (assets / equity)\n\nIf in a forth instance we substituted EBT for EBIT - interest expense, we get:\n\nROE = [EBIT / sales * sales / total assets - interest / total assets] * total assets / equity * [1 - tax / net before tax]\n\nSaid differently: \n\nROE = operating profit margin * asset turnover - interest expense rate * equity multiplier * tax retention\n\n\n\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_158", "text": "\n\nBenchmarking Financial Ratios\nFinancial ratios are not very useful on a stand-alone basis; they must be benchmarked against something. Analysts compare ratios against the following:\n\n1.The Industry norm - This is the most common type of comparison. Analysts will typically look for companies within the same industry and develop an industry average, which they will compare to the company they are evaluating. Ratios per industry are also provided by Bloomberg and the S&P. These are good sources of general industry information. Unfortunately, there are several companies included in an index that can distort certain ratios. If we look at the food and beverage ratio index, it will include companies that make prepared foods and some that are distributors. The ratios in this case would be distorted because one is a capital-intensive business and the other is not. As a result, it is better to use a cross-sectional analysis, i.e. individually select the companies that best fit the company being analyzed. \n\n2.Aggregate economy - It is sometimes important to analyze a company's ratio over a full economic cycle. This will help the analyst understand and estimate a company's performance in changing economic conditions, such as a recession.\n\r\n3.The company's past performance - This is a very common analysis. It is similar to a time-series analysis, which looks mostly for trends in ratios. \n\nLimitations of Financial Ratios\nThere are some important limitations of financial ratios that analysts should be conscious of:\n\n\nMany large firms operate different divisions in different industries. For these companies it is difficult to find a meaningful set of industry-average ratios.\n\nInflation may have badly distorted a company's balance sheet. In this case, profits will also be affected. Thus a ratio analysis of one company over time or a comparative analysis of companies of different ages must be interpreted with judgment. \n\nSeasonal factors can also distort ratio analysis. Understanding seasonal factors that affect a business can reduce the chance of misinterpretation. For example, a retailer's inventory may be high in the summer in preparation for the back-to-school season. As a result, the company's accounts payable will be high and its ROA low.\n\nDifferent accounting practices can distort comparisons even within the same company (leasing versus buying equipment, LIFO versus FIFO, etc.).\n\nIt is difficult to generalize about whether a ratio is good or not. A high cash ratio in a historically classified growth company may be interpreted as a good sign, but could also be seen as a sign that the company is no longer a growth company and should command lower valuations.\n\nA company may have some good and some bad ratios, making it difficult to tell if it's a good or weak company.\n\nIn general, ratio analysis conducted in a mechanical, unthinking manner is dangerous. On the other hand, if used intelligently, ratio analysis can provide insightful information.\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_159", "text": "\n\nI. Introduction\n\nSimple and Complex Capital Structures\nA simple capital structure is one that contains no potential dilutive securities. A company with a simple structure will have only common stockholders, preferred stockholders and nonconvertible debt.\n\nCompanies with simple capital structures only need to report basic EPS.\n\nA complex structure refers to one that contains potential dilutive securities. A company with a complex structure in addition to what is included in a company's simple capital structure will also include warrants and/or options and/or convertible debt instruments. \n\n- Companies that have a complex capital structure must report earnings per share (EPS) on a basic and fully diluted basis. \n\nEPS is simply the net income that is attributable to common shareholders divided by the number of shares outstanding. If a company has a complex capital structure, it means that a portion of their dilutive securities may be converted to equity at some point in time. Since EPS basic does not take into account these dilutive securities, EPS basic will always be greater than EPS fully diluted. \n\nBasic Earnings Per Share (EPS)\nEPS basic does not consider potential dilutive securities. A company with a simple capital structure will calculate only a basic EPS, which is defined as:\n\nFormula 7.45\n\n\n\n\nBasic EPS =  (net income - preferred dividends)_____\nweighted average number of shares outstanding\n\n\n\n\nSince we are interested only in the net income that belongs to common stockholders, preferred dividends are subtracted. Dividends, whether paid in cash or stock, or the additional dividend that is attributable to participating preferred shares must also be deducted. \n\nNote:\n\n- Dividends declared to common stockholders are not subtracted from ESP as they belong to common stockholders.\n- Preferred stock dividends are the current year's dividend only.\n(a) If none are declared, then calculate an amount equal to what the current dividend would have been.\n(b) Don't include dividends in arrears.\n(c) If a net loss occurs, add the preferred dividend.\n- EPS is calculated for each component of income: income from continuing operations, income before extraordinary items or changes in accounting principle, and net income.\n\nCalculating the Weighted Average Number of Shares Outstanding\nThe weighted average number of shares outstanding (WASO) is:\n\nFormula 7.46\n\n\n\n\nThe # of shares outstanding during each month, weighted by the # of months those shares were outstanding.\n\n\n\n\nIncluded are the impacts of all stock dividends and stock splits effective during the period and those announced after the end of the reporting period but before the financial statements are issued. Furthermore, all prior periods must be restated to facilitate comparative analysis.\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_160", "text": "\nSince in the Financial Statements section we described stock dividends and splits, here we will focus on their effects by considering an example. \n\nExample 1: Cash Dividend\nIn 2004, Company ABC generated a net income of $12 million and paid a dividend of $1 million to preferred stockholders.\n\nOther information:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first step is to average out the number of months the shares were outstanding:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer: Basic EPS = $12 million - $1 million / 3.8 million = $2.89\n\nExample 2: Stock Splits and Dividends\nStock splits and dividends are applied to all shares issued prior to the split and to the weighted average number of shares at the beginning of the period. In other words, if in this quarter a company declares a 2-to-1 stock split, then double the number of outstanding shares of prior months. \n\nFurthermore, if the company declares in Q3 a stock dividend of 10%, then increase the number of shares outstanding by 10% of prior months. Shares that are repurchased from treasury after the stock split and dividends should not be adjusted.\n\nOther information:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first step is to account for the stock dividend in Q3:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second step is average out the number of month the shares were outstanding:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer: Basic EPS = $12m -$1m/ 4.28m = $2.57\n\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_161", "text": "\n\nDilutive Securities are securities that are not common stock in form, but allow the owner to obtain common stock upon exercise of an option or a conversion privilege. The most common examples of dilutive securities are: stock options, warrants, convertible debt and convertible preferred stock. These securities would decrease EPS if exercised or if they were converted common stock. In other words, a dilutive security is any securities that could increase the weighted number of shares outstanding.\n\nIf a security after conversion causes the EPS figure to increase rather than decrease, such a security is an anti-dilutive security, and it should be excluded from the computation of the dilutive EPS. \n\nFor example, assume that the company XYZ has a convertible bond issue: 100 bonds, $1,000 par value, yielding 10%, issued at par for the total of $100,000. Each bond can be converted into 50 shares of the common stock. The tax rate is 30%. XYZ's weighted average number of shares, used to compute basic EPS, is 10,000. XYZ reported an NI of $12,000, and paid preferred dividends of $2,000. \n\nWhat is the basic EPS? What is the diluted EPS?\n\n1) Compute basic EPS:\ni. Basic EPS = (12,000 - 2,000) / (10,000) = $1.00\n\n2) Compute diluted EPS: \ni. Find the adjustment to the denominator: 100 * 50 = 5,000\nii. Find the adjustment to the numerator: 100 * $1000 * 0.1 * (1 - 0.3) = $7,000\n\n3) Find diluted EPS:\ni. Diluted EPS = (12,000 - 2,000 + 7,000) / 10,000 + 5,000 = $1.13\n\nIf the fully dilused EPS > basic EPS, then the security is antidilutive. In this case, Basic EPS = $1.00 is less than the fully diluted ESP, and the security is antidilutive.\n\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_162", "text": "\nThere are some basic rules for calculating basic and fully diluted ESP in a complex capital structure. The basic ESP is calculated in the same fashion as it is in a simple capital structure.\nBasic and fully diluted EPS are calculated for each component of income: income from continuing operations, income before extraordinary items or changes in accounting principle, and net income.\nTo calculate fully diluted EPS:\nDiluted EPS = [(net income - preferred dividend) / weighted average number of shares outstanding - impact of convertible securities - impact of options, warrants and other dilutive securities]\nOther form:\n(net income - preferred dividends) + convertible preferred dividend + (convertible debt interest * (1-t))\nDivided by\nweighted average shares + shares from conversion of convertible preferred shares + shares from conversion of convertible debt + shares issuable from stock options.\nTo understand this complex calculation we will look at each possibility:\nIf the company has convertible bonds, use the if-converted method:\n1.Treat conversion as occurring at the beginning of the year or at issuance date, if it occurred during the year (additive to denominator).\n2.Eliminate related interest expense, net of tax (additive to numerator).\nIf the company has convertible preferred stock, use the if-converted method:\n1. Eliminate preferred dividend from numerator (decrease numerator).\n2. Treat conversion as occurring at the beginning of the year or at issuance date, if it occurred during the year (additive to denominator). Furthermore, use the most advantageous conversion rate available to the holder of the security.\nOptions and warrants use the treasury-stock method:\n1.Assume that exercise occurred at the beginning of the year or issue date, if it occurs during the year.\n2.Assume that proceeds are used to purchase common stock for treasury stock.\n3.If exercise price < market price of stock, dilution occurs.\n4.If exercise price > market price, securities are anti-dilative and can be ignored in the diluted EPS calculation.\nExample:\nCompany ABC has:\n- Net income of $2m and 2m weighted average number of shares outstanding for the accounting period.\n- Bonds convertible to common stock worth $50,000: 50 at $1,000, with an interest of 12%. They are convertible to 1,000 shares of common stock.\n- A total of 1,000 convertible preferred stock paying a dividend of 10% and convertible to 2,000 shares of common stock, with a par of $100 per preferred stock.\n- A total of 2,000 stock options outstanding, 1,000 of which were issued with an exercise price of $10 and the other 1,000 of which have an exercise price of $50. Each stock option is convertible to\n10 common stocks.\n- A tax rate of 40%.\n- Stock whose average trading price is $20 per share.\nCalculate the fully diluted EPS\n1.Convertible debt\nAssume conversion:\nIf the debt is converted, the company would have to issue an additional 50,000 (50*1,000) common stock. As a result the WASO would increase to 2,050,000.\nSince the debt would be converted, no interest would have to be paid. Interest was $6,000 per annum. The interest expense would flow through to common stockholders but not before the IRS get a portion of it. So net of taxes the company would have generated an additional $3,600 [(6,000*(1-40%)] in net income.\nAdjusted WASO: 2,050,000\nAdjusted net income: $2,003,600\n2.\u00a0Convertible preferred stock\nAssume conversion:\nIf the stock is converted the company would have to issue an additional 2,000 shares of common stock. As a result the WASO would increase to 2,052,000.\nSince the preferred dividend would no longer be issued the company would not have to pay $10,000 dividends (100*1,000*10%). Since dividends are not tax deductible, there are no tax implications. So the company would have generated an additional $10,000 in net income attributable to common stockholders.\nAdjusted WASO: 2,052,000\nAdjusted net income: $2,003,600\nPreferred dividend is reduced to zero, because Preferred Dividends will cancel each other out following the Diluted EPS Formula above\u00a0(assuming all preferred stock is convertible preferred stock).\u00a0\n3.Stock options\nIf-converted method:\nSay there are 1,000 stock options in the money (exercise price < market price of stock). The holders of the stock option can convert their options into stock for a profit at any point and time.\nSay 1,000 stock options are out of the money (exercise price > market price of stock). The holders of the stock option would not convert their options, because it would be cheaper to purchase the stock on the open market.\nThe out-of-the-money option can be ignored. The in-the-money options need to be accounted for.\nHere is how in-the-money options are accounted for:\n1) Calculate the amount raised through the exercise of options:\n1000 * 10 *$10 = $100,000\n2) Calculate the number of the common shares that can be repurchased using the amount raised through the exercise of options (found in step #1):\n$100,000 / 20 = 5,000\n3) Calculate number of common shares created by the exercise of the stock options:\n1000 * 10 = 10,000\n4) Find the net number by which the number of new common shares, created as result of the stock options exercised (found in step #3), exceed the number of common shares repurchased at the market price with proceeds received from the exercise of the options (found in step #2):\n10,000 - 5,000 = 5,000\n5) Find the total number of shares if the stock options are exercised: add weighted average number of shares to what you found in step #4:\n2,052,000 + 5,000 = 2,057,000\nFully diluted EPS=\u00a02,000,000 + 3,600 -\u00a010,000\u00a0+\u00a010,000\u00a0=\u00a02,003,600\u00a0= 0.974\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2,000,000 +50,000 + 2,000 +5,000\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2,057,000\nPresentation and disclosure\nSimple capital structure\na.

This is referred to as \"extending credit to customers\". Under accrual accounting, sales made on credit are recorded on the income statement. The not-yet-collected money is recorded under accounts receivable. Unfortunately, some customers will not want or be able to pay (because of bankruptcy) the company. \n\nCompany's can utilize two different approaches to account for these uncollectible accounts. The first is to account for them as they occur. Companies mostly use this method for income tax calculations and/or because its bad debts are immaterial. This method is called the \"direct write-off method of accounting for bad debts\". Once the company determines that an account is uncollectible, it will debit (which is an increase) the bad debt expense and credit accounts receivable (which is a decrease)\n\nThe second method used by companies, which is more consistent with the matching accounting principle, is to estimate the bad debt on an ongoing basis. This is referred to as the \"allowance method for bad debt\", and it is accounted for in allowance for doubtful accounts. \n\nAccounting for Credit Sales\n\n1) The direct write-off method\n\nABC sells and delivers $200,000 in products to 3C, which has 30 days to pay. \n\nHere's the accounting record:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 3C account has been overdue for six months and will most likely be uncollectible.

They can be valued on a continuous basis (physical count of inventory will be done after each sale) or periodically (physical count of inventory will be done at the end of each period). For most businesses, continuous revaluation of their inventory is too expensive and generates little value. As a result, most companies evaluate their inventory periodically.\n\nThe inventory-costing methods used relate to the way management has decided to evaluate the cost of their inventory, for example, specific identification, average cost, first in first out (FIFO), or last in first out (LIFO). The costing method will have an impact on the estimated value of the inventory on hand and the estimated cost of goods sold (COGS) reported on the income statement. \n\nThe valuation method is the process by which the inventory is valued. GAAP requires inventory to be valued at the lower of cost to market (LCM) valuation. Market valuation is defined as replacement cost. The choices made by management with the inventory- processing systems, the inventory-costing method and the valuation method used will affect what is reported on a company's balance sheet, net income statement (profits) and cash flow statement. All these choices should be driven by the application of the matching principle. Unfortunately, these choices are sometimes driven by the owner/management tax implications (usually among private companies), or by the intention to artificially increase a company's profitability (usually among public companies). \n\nInventory Cost\nInventory cost is the net invoice price (less discounts) plus any freight and transit insurance plus taxes and tariffs. Inventory includes not only inventory on hand but also inventory in transit. Furthermore, inventory does not have to be a finished product to the included.\n\nThe cost of inventory can be calculated based on:\n1) the specific identification method, \n2) the average-cost method, \n3) first in, first out (FIFO), and \n4) last in, first out (LIFO)\n\nGAAP allows management to use four methods to evaluate inventory. We will use the following example to illustrate each of these methods.\n\nExample: Company ABC purchased these items in May, and sold item 102 and 103 for a total of $300:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1) The Specific-identification Inventory Method\nUnder this inventory method each unit purchased for resale is identified and accounted for by its invoice.

To manipulate the earnings management could simply stop purchasing new inventory and start dipping into their old and cheap inventory. This is call \"LIFO liquidation\".\n\nMost U.S. companies use LIFO as opposed to FIFO. Given the fact that the U.S. has seen cost of inventory rise over the last 30 years (inflation) these companies were able to save on taxes. One should know that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) does not allow companies to report LIFO for tax purposes and then FIFO on their general-purpose statements. \n\nAnalyzing the Financial Statements of Companies That Use Different Inventory Accounting Methods\nWhen comparing two companies, one must ensure that they are comparing apples with apples. If the first company uses the FIFO method and the other the LIFO method, then there is a problem.

Furthermore, there is little value in converting inventory under FIFO to LIFO, since LIFO inventory is not a reflection of the true economic value of inventory. Nonetheless, analysts can estimate what the inventory and COGS would have been if the company used the LIFO accounting method.\n\nAnalysts would first need to estimate what the beginning inventory would have been under LIFO. Inventory can be affected by economic inflation, inflation of raw assets with a particular industry, among others. As a result, COGS (LIFO) can be estimated by using this formula:\n\nCOGS (LIFO) = COGS (FIFO) + [beginning inventory (FIFO) * (adjustment or inflation rate)]\n\nLooking at a company within a similar industry that uses the LIFO method can also be done to derive the adjustment rate. \n\nAdjustment rate = LIFO reserve / beginning inventory (LIFO)\n\nConverting Average-cost Method to LIFO\nAs stated previously, since the average-cost method is a simple average of COGS, COGS would be in between LIFO and FIFO.\n\nCOGS (LIFO) = COGS (average) - \u00bd * (beginning inventory (Average) * (adjustment or inflation rate)\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_172", "text": "\n\nA company's choice of inventory accounting will affect the company's income, cash flow and balance sheet.\n\n\nIncome effect - Inventory and cost of goods sold are interdependent.

Under this scenario, net income will be lower compared to a company that used FIFO accounting. \n\n\nCash flow effect - If we lived in a tax-free world, there would be no cash flow difference between inventory-accounting methods. Unfortunately, we do pay taxes. As a result, if a company uses the FIFO method in a rising-price and increasing-inventory environment, it will have to generate a lower COGS and a higher net taxable income, and pay higher taxes. Tax expenses are a real cash expense and lower a company's cash flow.\n\n\nWorking Capital - Working capital is defined as current assets minus current liabilities. If one method produces a higher inventory value in the income statement, the working capital will increase. \n\nTable 8.1 Summary of effects given a rising-prices environment and stable or increasing inventories\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Effects of the Inventory Method On Ratios\nSince the accounting method used to account for inventory has an effect on the income statement, balance sheet and cash flow statement, it will ultimately have an effect on the ratios used to measure and compare a company's profitability, liquidity, activity and solvency. While temporary, any significant changes in ratios can have effects on the company's stock price. While analysts may recognize that the changes in the ratios are sourced from the methods, in the world of rapid information dissemination, traders and investors often react before the news is fully digested. This is a table that is important to commit to memory. Keep in mind, one method is not necessarily better than the other and often reverse during the next reporting periods so the effects are dynamic in nature. \n\nComputing Profitability Effects\nIn a rising-price and stable- or increasing-inventory environment,LIFO will have a higher COGS, but it will also be more representative of the current economic reality. As a result, profitability will be more accurate, and a better indicator of future profitability. FIFO will use the cost of the old stock to determine the COGS, making the profitability ratio less reflective of the current economic reality. \n\nAs a general rule, in a rising-price and stable- or increasing-inventory environment,using profitability measures based on LIFO is better. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLook Out!\n\n\n\n\nMost questions relating to the differences under LIFO and FIFO will include a descriptive effect on financial ratios.

On the other hand, if we use FIFO, the COGS does not represent the current economic reality. In this case the best thing to do is to use the COGS found under LIFO and divide it by the average inventory found in FIFO. This is called \"current-cost method\". \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLook Out!\n\n\n\n\nFrom an analytical perspective, in a rising-price and stable- or increasing-inventory environment, it is better to use FIFO total asset turnover ratios because LIFO ending inventory is the older, cheaper inventory.\n\n\n\n\nSolvency ratios\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom an analytical perspective, in a rising-price and stable- or increasing-inventory environment, it is better to use LIFO debt-to-equity ratio because the retained earnings are more representative of the current economic reality. For the time, interest-earned ratio is more relevant to use LIFO because EBIT will be lower and more representative of future interest-coverage protection. If the company is currently using FIFO, it is better they use the CFO generated by FIFO because the company cannot change the fact that it will have to continue paying higher taxes under this method.\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_173", "text": "\n\nLIFO reserves decline because a company is doing the following:\n\n\nliquidating its inventory (lower quantities / selling cheap/old stock)\n\nis purchasing inventory at lower prices (price decline) \n\nThe liquidation of inventory is called \"LIFO liquidation\". This happens when a company is no longer purchasing additional inventory (prices are high) and is depleting its old and cheap cost-base inventory. This can produce large increases in profitability (COGS abnormally low). This increase in profitability is temporary (paper profit). Once it runs out of cheap inventory, it will have to purchase new inventory at a mush higher cost base. This will also decrease a company's cash flow because it will have to pay more taxes. Profits from LIFO liquidation are non-operating in nature and should be excluded from earnings in an analysis. \n\nA decline in price reduces the COGS under LIFO, but though COGS is lower it is a better indication of the economic reality.

These assets are reported at cost (book value) at initiation, and are depreciated over time (except for land).

If an asset becomes obsolete before its time or it has lost its revenue-generating ability, it must be written off and this is referred to as asset impairment. \n\nProperty, Plant and Equipment (PP&E)\nThe cost of PP&E includes all costs related to their acquisition and all necessary expenses required to make them useful for the company.\n\nExample 1:\nCompany ABC purchased a machine for $2m.

This cost allocation can be based on a number of factors, but it is always related to the estimated period of time the product can generate revenues for the company (economic life). Depreciation expense is the amount of cost allocation within an accounting period. Only items that lose useful value over time can be depreciated. That said, land can't be depreciated because it can always be used for a purpose. \n\nStraight-line Depreciation\nThe simplest and most commonly used method, straight-line depreciation is calculated by taking the purchase or acquisition price of an asset, subtracting by the salvage value (value at which it can be sold once the company no longer needs it) and dividing by the total productive years for which the asset can be reasonably expected to benefit the company, or its useful life. \n\nExample: For $2m, Company ABC purchased a machine that will have an estimated useful life of five years.

Furthermore, its accumulated production units equal the total estimated production capacity.

This results in an overstatement of reported income and asset value. \n\nHours-of-service Depreciation\nThis is the same concept as unit of production depreciation except that the depreciation expense is a function of total hours of service used during an accounting period. \n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_176", "text": "\n\nAccelerated depreciation allows companies to write off their assets faster in earlier years than the straight-line depreciation method and to write off a smaller amount in the later years.

As time passes the useful life of a company's equipment may be cut short (new technology), and its salvage value may also be affected. Once this happens there is asset impairment.\n\nCompanies can do two things: \n\n1) They can accelerate the asset's depreciation and fix the reduction in useful life or salvage value over time or \n\n2) They can do the recommended thing, which is to recognize the impairment and report it on the income statement right away. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLook Out!\n\n\n\n\nNote that changes in useful life and salvage value are considered changes in accounting estimates, not changes in accounting principle.

The main assets these companies have are their inventory of natural resources. These assets must be reported at their cost of carry (or carrying cost). The carrying costs for natural resources include the cost of acquiring the lands or mines, cost of timber-cutting rights and the cost of exploration and development of the natural resources. These costs can be capitalized or expensed. The costs that are capitalized are included in the cost of carry. The cost of carry does not include the cost of machinery and equipment used in the extraction process. \n\nWhen a resource company purchases a plot of land, it not only pays for the physical asset but also pays a large premium because of what is contained in the plot of land. That said, once a company starts extracting the oil or natural resource from the land, the land loses value, because the natural resources extracted from a plot of land will never regenerate. That loss in value is called \"depletion\". That is why cost of carry is depleted over time. The depletion of these assets must be included in the income statement's accounting period. This is the only time land can be depleted. \n\nThe carrying costs of natural resources are allocated to an accounting period by means of the units-of-production method. \n\nExample: \nA company acquired cutting rights for $1m. With these cutting rights, the company will be able to cut 5,000 trees. In its first year of operation, the company cut 200 trees. \n\nJournal entries:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_177", "text": "\n\nClassification of Natural Resource Assets\r\nIntangible assets are identifiable non-monetary resources that have no physical substance but provide the company controlling them with a benefit.

Intangible assets are depreciated over their estimated life and they are done so by the use the straight-line depreciation method. Intangible assets cannot have an estimated life of more then 40 years. \n\nUnlike other intangible assets, goodwill is no longer an asset that can be depreciated. As of July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) adopted the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, which sets new rules for goodwill accounting. SFAS 142 eliminates goodwill amortization and instead requires companies to identify reporting units and perform goodwill impairment tests.\n\nExample\nCompany ABC acquires a company for $20m. The acquired company's fair market value was $18m. ABC has also acquired a patent for $2m that has an estimated remaining life of 10 years. \n\nJournal entries:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_178", "text": "\n\nExpenses can be expensed as they are incurred, or they can be capitalized. A company is able to capitalize the cost of acquiring a resource only if the resource provides the company with a tangible benefit for more than one operating cycle. In this regard, these expenses represent an asset for the company and are recorded on the balance sheet. \nEffects of Capitalization on Key Figures\nThe decision to capitalize or expense some items depends on management. As such, this choice will have an impact on a company's balance sheet, income statement and cash flow statement. It will also have an impact on a company's financial ratios.\nHere is what the decision will have an impact on:\nNet income - Capitalizing costs and depreciating them over time will show a smoother pattern of reported incomes. Expensing firms have higher variability in reported income. In terms of profitability, in the early years, a company that capitalizes costs will have a higher profitability than it would have had if it expensed them. In later years, the company that expenses costs will have a higher profitability than it would have had if it capitalized them.\n\nStockholders' equity - Over a long time frame, the choice of expensing a cost or capitalizing it will have little effect on a shareholders' total equity. That said, expensing firms will have a lower stockholders' equity at first (less profit, thus smaller retained earnings).\n\nCash flow from operations - A company that capitalizes its costs will display higher net profits in the first years and will have to pay higher taxes than it would've had to pay if it expensed all of its costs. That said, over a long period of time, the tax implications would be the same. But the choice for capitalizing over expensing have a much larger effect on the reported cash flow from operations and cash flow from investing. If a company expenses its cost it will be included in cash flow from operations. If it capitalizes, then it will be included in cash flow from investing (lower investment cash flow and higher cash flow from operations).\n\nAssets reported on the balance sheet - A company that capitalizes its costs will display higher total assets. \n\nFinancial ratios - A company that capitalizes its costs will display higher profitability ratios at the onset and lower ratios in the later stages. Liquidity ratios will experience little impact, except for the CFO ratio, which will be higher under the capitalization method. Operation-efficiency ratios such as total asset and fixed-asset turnover will be lower under the capitalization method, due to higher reported fixed assets. Furthermore, at the onset, equity turnover will be higher under the capitalization method (lower total equity due to lower net profit). Companies that capitalize their costs will initially report higher net income, lower equity and higher total assets. Remember that, on average, an equal dollar effect on a numerator and denominator will produce a higher net result. That said, on average, ROE & ROA will initially be higher for capitalizing firms. Solvency ratios are better for firms that capitalize their costs because they have higher assets, EBIT and stockholders' equity.\nConsider figure 8.2 below for an overview of the effect of capitalizing and expensing on key financial ratios.\nFigure 8.2 Impact of Assets, Profitability on Financial Ratios\n\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_179", "text": "\n\nIf interest is capitalized, it is included in the cost of carry. Capitalizing interest is common in construction projects. The interest cost is included as an asset versus being expensed on the income statement for the period it occurred. \n\nIn the U.S., SFAS 34 governs the capitalization of interest cost during an accounting period. SFAS 34 requires that the interest cost incurred during a construction period is accounted for as a long-lived asset. To be capitalized, the interest must be from borrowed money. If no specific borrowing is identified, interest can be estimated by means of a weighted average interest rate on outstanding debt for the amount invested. \n\nExample:\nA company built a building for $1m. It borrowed $500,000 at 5% to build the building. In this case the interest capitalized will amount to $25,000.\n\nAnother company built a building for $1m. It borrowed $500,000 at 5% to build the building; it also had an outstanding debenture of $3m at 10% and a $1M mortgage at 15%. In this case, the interest capitalized will amount to:\n\n500,000 * 5% = 25,000\n500,000 * 10% = 50,000\nTotal   75,000\n\nInterest to be expensed = total interest paid - capitalized interest\n\n= 25,000+300,000+150,000-75,000\n= 400,000\n\nThe total capitalized interest is $75,000 because we assume the $500,000 balance was financed through the debenture. The reason we do not consider the mortgage is that it is already assigned to another identifiable asset. \n\nSome argue that the capitalization costs of self-financed assets should not be included.\n\nThe decision to capitalize interest will have an effect on a company's:\n\n\nNet income - In the current period earnings will be higher (overstated). \n\nCFO - In the current period, CFO will be higher (overstated) because the interest expense will be included in CFI.\n\nCFI - In the current period, CFI will be lower (understated).\n\nAssets - Total assets will be overstated because they include the capitalized interest. \n\nSolvency ratios - Since assets, EBIT and stockholders' equity will be higher, all solvency ratios will be overstated. \n\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_180", "text": "\n\nIntangible assets are identifiable non-monetary resources that have no physical substance but provide the company controlling them with a benefit and, as a result, have a higher degree of uncertainty regarding future benefits.

SFAS classifies intangible assets in different categories and provides a guideline in regards to their expense or capitalization.\n\n1.

The sinking-fund depreciation is rarely used and is prohibited in the U.S. and some other countries. Under this depreciation method, the amount of depreciation increases every year to maintain a fixed internal rate of return (IRR). \n\nFormula 8.6\n\nDepreciation in year i = CF in year i - (IRR * book value at beginning of the year)\n\nCF is defined as the cash derived every year from a particular asset.\n\nEffect of depreciation on financial statements, ratios and taxes:\n\n\nStraight-line depreciation - This method will create a steady income stream, tax expense and ratios. Return on assets will increase over time if the equipment continues to generate the same products and price per unit remains constant. \n\nPer unit of production and per hour of service - These depreciation methods produce a variable depreciation expense. Net income will vary but it could be more reflective of production-to-cost (matching principle). One of the drawbacks of this method is that if units of products decrease (slowing demand for the product), depreciation expense also decreases, resulting in an overstatement of reported income and asset value. \n\nDeclining balance - Income will be lower in the first years. As a result taxes will be lower and CFO will be higher. If production and selling prices of goods remain constant, ROA will be much higher in later years. \n\nSinking-fund depreciation - The only benefit of this method is that the income reported should reflect ROI earned by assets.\n\nDepreciable Life\nDepreciable life, whether it is defined by years of useful life or by production units, is the most significant estimate that must be made in the determination of the depreciation expense. \n\nThe estimated salvage value of an asset is also important but not as significant. The role of depreciable life and salvage value is important because it is an estimation given by management. As such, management can use this estimation choice to manipulate current and future earnings. \n\nThe most common form of manipulation is an overstatement in the write-down of assets during a restructuring process, which will be reported as an extraordinary item and will result in the inflation of future net profits.\n\nChanging Depreciation Methods\nChanges in depreciation methods can be done in three ways:\n\n\nChange the depreciation method for all newly acquired assets.\n\nChange the depreciation method for current and all new assets.\n\nChange in depreciable life or salvage value.\n\n\nChanging the Depreciation Method for All Newly Acquired Assets\nThe change in depreciation method will only affect future acquired assets. As a result, no past adjustment need to be made; the only thing that will change is future depreciation expense. \n\nThat said, the change in depreciation expense will be gradual, and the change in ratios will also be gradual. \n\nChange the Depreciation Method for Current and All New Assets\nThis is a much more complex change and will require all past assets to be restated to reflect the new depreciation accounting method. For all new assets it's not really a problem, but for the past assets the cumulative effect of the changes on past income statements must be reported (net of tax) on the current income statement. Furthermore, these changes must be included in net income from continuing operations. \n\nExample of effect:\nSay a company changes its depreciation method, the straight-line method, to one that would have previously created a larger depreciation expense, the double-declining method). \n\nThis will cause past expenses to be higher and income to be lower. At the time of recognition, net income from continuing operations will decrease. Future depreciation expense will decrease (they would have already been expensed) but will increase in future years once all of the old assets are replaced.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLook Out!\n\n\n\n\nROE and ROA will decrease even though assets and equity will decrease; the larger impact will come from a large decrease in net income.\n\n\n\n\nChange in Depreciable Life or Salvage Value\nA change in depreciable life and/or salvage value is not considered an acting policy change; it is a change in estimate. As a result, a company is not required to restate it in financial statements. The only thing that will change is the current and future net income. \n\nFor example, if an asset's life is shortened, this will increase the company's current and future depreciation expense, and decrease net income, ROA and ROE. \n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_182", "text": "\n\nThe disclosure found in a company's footnote section of its financial statements provides useful information about the age and possible usefulness of the assets held by the company. Using the information contained in the footnote, an analyst can estimate the total age of the assets held by a company. \n\nThere are three ways to estimate the average age of a company's fixed assets:\n\n\nAverage age = accumulated depreciation / current depreciation expense = X years\n\nRelative age = accumulated depreciation / ending gross investment = % of age\n\nAverage depreciable life = ending gross investment / depreciation expense\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLook Out!\n\n\n\n\nNote: All these estimations are affected by what is included in fixed assets (asset mix).

Once impairment has been recognized it cannot be restored. Analysts must know that some foreign countries and the IASB allow companies to recognize increases in previously impaired assets. \n\nAsset impairment occurs when there are:\n\n\nChanges in regulation and business climate\n\nDeclines in usage rate\n\nTechnology changes\n\nForecasts of a significant decline in the long-term profitability of the asset \n\nOnce a company has determined that an asset is impaired, it can write down the asset or classify it as an asset for sale. Assets will be written down if the company keeps on using this asset. Write-downs are sometimes included as part of a restructuring cost. It is important to be able to distinguish asset write-downs, which are non-cash expenses, from cash expenses like severance packages.\n\nWrite-downs affect past reported income. The loss should be reported on the income statement before tax as a component of continuing operations. Generally impairment recognized for financial reporting is not deductible for tax purposes until the affected assets are disposed of. That said, in most cases recognition of an impairment leads to a deferred tax asset.\n\nImpaired assets held for sale are assets that are no longer in use and are expected to be disposed of or abandoned. The disposition decision differs from a write-down because once a company classifies impaired assets as assets for sale or abandonment, it is actually severing these assets from assets of continuing operations as they are no longer expected to contribute to ongoing operations. This is the accounting impact: assets held for sales must be written down to fair value less the cost of selling them. These assets can no longer be depreciated. \n\nAssets Impairment - Effects on Financial Statements and Ratios\n\n\nPast income statements are not restated. The current income statement will include an impairment loss in income before tax from continuing operations. Net income will also be lower.\n\nOn the balance sheet, long-term assets are reduced by the impairment. A deferred-tax asset is created (if there was a deferred tax liability it is reduced). Stockholders' equity is reduced as a result of the impairment loss included in the income statement. \n\nCurrent and future fixed-asset turnover will increase (lower fixed assets).\n\nSince stockholders' equity will be lower, debt-to-equity will be lower.\n\nDebt-to-assets will be higher.\n\nCash flow based ratios will remain unaffected (no cash implications).\n\nFuture net income will be higher as there will be lower asset value, and thus a smaller depreciation expense. \n\nFuture ROA and ROE will increase.\n\nPast ratios that evaluated fixed assets and depreciation policy are distorted by impairment write-downs.\n\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_184", "text": "\n        This chapter will focus on the liability side of the balance sheet, particularly current and long-term liabilities including capital and operating leases.

Liabilities represent others' rights to money or services of the company.

Long-term obligations are reported as the present value of all future cash payments.\n\nUncertainties Regarding Liability Value\r\nIn some cases the timing and/or the total liability may be difficult to estimate:\n\n\r\n\t\tSome companies offer clients a warranty period. The company does not know at the time of the sale who the payee will be. Furthermore, the company does not know when this payment will occur.\n\r\n\t\tAt year-end some companies will estimate some expenses, and recognize some liabilities such as pension benefits.\n\nRecording and Reporting Estimated and Contingent Liabilities\r\nLiabilities whose timing and amount are known can easily be accounted for. But others - such as warranties, taxes, vacation-pay liability and contingent liabilities, among others - require some estimation.\n\nWarranties\r\nWhen a company sells a product, it sometimes offers its customers a warranty of a certain number of years. To be consistent with the matching principle, companies, at the time of the sale, must estimate an amount that must be allocated to the costs associated with the warranties. Most companies will use a historical or industry average to estimate its warranty cost. The estimated warranty cost or liability will be allocated to the estimated warranty liability. For example, say Company ABC sells 100 appliances at $100 and estimates that each appliance will carry a $10 warranty liability.\n\r\nJournal entry:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTaxes\r\nDue to timing differences, companies will report deferred income tax liabilities. These are taxes that have not yet been paid but are expected to be paid in the future. For example, say Company ABC estimates its tax bill will total $500. At year-end it has an actual tax bill of $600.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVacation-pay Liability\r\nThis liability arises when employees do not take their vacation during an accounting period.

The most frequent contingent liability is a pending lawsuit against the company, which will materialize only if the firm is found guilty. Pending lawsuits can be significantly large for some companies, especially those involved in large class action lawsuits with hundreds or even thousands of potential plaintiffs. Examples of these industries include pharmaceuticals, oil companies or any company that produces large amounts of products that can harm consumers.\n\r\nThe disclosure and/or inclusion of contingent liabilities in a company's financial statements will depend on the company's ability to estimate the amount of the liability and the likelihood that it will occur.\n\r\nRules for classifying liabilities:\r\n\n\r\n\t\tIf the liability is probable and can be reasonably estimated, it must be included in the company's financial statements.

This will create a temporary difference between the tax basis of an asset or liability and its reported amount in the financial statements. This difference will result in taxable amounts or deductible amounts in future years when the asset is recovered or the liability is settled. This is known as \"deferred income taxes\".\n\nTax Terminology Basics\n\n\nTaxable income is the amount of income subject to income taxes over the company's reporting period.\n\nTax payable refers to the tax liability recorded on the balance sheet as a result of taxable income. Tax payable is the amount of taxes that has not been paid but will be in the near term.\n\nIncome tax paid is the actual taxes paid out of cash. This includes what was paid for this period and other periods during this accounting period.\n\nTax-loss carry-forward occurs when a company has created a net loss within an accounting period that it cannot use to lower previous income taxes paid but can be used in the future to offset future taxable income.\n\nTerminology Found on the Income Statement\n\n\nTax payable includes total taxes to be paid within the accounting period. Said differently, it is equal to the amount of income taxes paid or payable for the period.\n\nDeferred tax expenses represent the increase in the deferred tax-liability balance from the beginning to the end of the accounting period (noncash expense).\n\nIncome tax expense includes tax payable and deferred income tax expenses. It is composed of cash and noncash items. Thus it is not the actual tax paid to the government within the accounting period.\n\nTerminology Found on the Balance Sheet\n\n\nDeferred tax asset represents the increase in taxes refundable (saved) in future years as a result of deductible temporary differences at the end of the current year.\n\nDeferred tax liability represents the increase in taxes payable in future years as a result of taxable temporary differences existing at the end of the current year.\n\nOther terminology:\n\n\nValuation allowance represents that portion of the deferred tax asset that is more likely not to be realized.\n\nTypes of Differences\n\n\nTemporary difference is the difference between the book basis and tax basis of an asset or liability that is expected to reverse over time.\n\nPermanent difference is the difference between the book basis and tax basis of an asset or liability that is not expected to reverse over time.\n\n\n\n\n\nLook Out!\r\n\t\t\t\tNote: Temporary differences create deferred taxes, while permanent differences cause a firm's effective income tax rate (book income tax expense / pre-tax book income) to differ from the statutory tax rate.\n\n\n\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_187", "text": "\n\nA deferred tax liability occurs when taxable income is smaller than the income reported on the income statements. This is a result of the accounting difference of certain income and expense accounts. This is only a temporary difference. The most common reason behind deferred tax liability is the use of different depreciation methods for financial reporting and the IRS.\n\nA deferred tax asset is the opposite of a deferred tax liability. Deferred tax assets are reductions in future taxes payable, because the company has already paid the taxes on book income to be recognized in the future (like a prepaid tax).\n\nCalculation:\n\nDeferred tax liability\n\n\nBook basis - tax basis of asset or liability = cumulative temporary difference (cumulative temporary differences x enacted tax rate).\n\nScheduling of future taxable amounts.\n\nDeferred tax asset\n\n\nBook basis - tax basis of asset or liability = cumulative temporary difference (cumulative temporary difference x enacted tax rate).\n\nScheduling of deductible amounts.\n\nThe Liability Method of Accounting for Deferred Taxes.\r\nThere are several different tax-allocation methods:\n\nDeferred Method\nThe amount of deferred income tax is based on tax rates in effect when temporary differences originate. It is an income-statement-oriented approach. It emphasizes proper matching of expenses with revenues in the period when a temporary difference originates. Finally, it is not acceptable under GAAP.\n\nAsset-liability Method\nThe amount of deferred income tax is based on the tax rates expected to be in effect during the periods in which the temporary differences reverse. It is a balance-sheet-oriented approach. It emphasizes the usefulness of financial statements in evaluating financial position and predicting future cash flows. Most importantly, it is the only method accepted by GAAP.\n\nImplications of Valuation Allocation\nA deferred tax asset is a reduction in future cash outflow (taxes to be paid). But, the asset has value only if the firm expects to pay taxes in the future. For example, an Net Operating Loss (NOL) carry-forward is worthless if the firm does not expect to have positive taxable income for the next 20 years. Since accounting is conservative, firms must reduce the value of their deferred tax assets by a deferred tax-asset valuation allowance. This is a contra-asset account CR (credit) balance on the balance sheet - just like accumulated depreciation or the allowance for uncollectible accounts) that reduces the deferred tax asset to its expected realizable value.\n\nIncreasing the valuation allowance increases deferred income tax expense; decreasing the allowance does the opposite. Changes in the allowance affect income tax expense. Although the need for an allowance is subjective, its existence and magnitude reveals management's expectation of future earnings. Management can use changes in the allowance to \"manipulate\" NI by affecting income tax expense. Analysts should scrutinize these types of changes.\n\nDeferred Tax Liability Treatment\nIf a tax asset or liability is simply the result of a timing difference that is expected to reverse in the future, it is best classified as an asset or liability. But if it is not expected to reverse in the future, it is best qualified as equity.\n\r\nDeferred tax liabilities that should be treated as equity in the following circumstances:\n\n\nA company has created a deferred tax liability because it used accelerated depreciation for tax purposes and not for financial-reporting purposes. If the company expects to continue purchasing equipment indefinitely, it is unlikely that the reversal will take place, and, as such it should be considered as equity. But if the company stops growing its operations, then we can expect this deferred liability to materialize, and it should be considered a true liability. \n\nAn analyst determines that the deferred tax liability is unlikely to be realized for other reasons; the liability should then be reclassified as stockholders' equity.\n\n\n\n\n\nLook Out!\r\n\t\t\t\tIn some cases the deferred tax liability should not be added to stockholders' equity, but should be ignored as a liability.\n\n\n\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_188", "text": "\n        Temporary (or timing) differences between book income versus taxable income are due to items of revenue or expense that are recognized in one period for taxes, but in a different period for the books. Book recognition can come before or after tax recognition. These revenue and expense items cause a timing difference between the two incomes, but over the \"long run\", they cause no difference between the two incomes. This is why they are temporary. When the difference first arises, it is called \"an originating timing difference\". When it later reverses it is called \"a reversing timing difference\". Here are two examples of temporary differences: (1) the calculation of depreciation expense by means of the straight-line method for books and by means of an accelerated method for taxes, and (2) the calculation of bad-debts expense by means of the allowance method for books and by means of the direct write-off method for taxes.\n\r\nOver the life of the firm, total depreciation expense and bad debts expense are unaffected by the method. What is affected is how much expense is recognized in any given period. Temporary differences are said to \"reverse\" because if they cause book income to be higher (or lower) than taxable income in one period, they must cause taxable income to be higher (or lower) than book income in another period.\n\r\nPermanent differences are differences that never reverse. That is, they are items of book (or tax) revenue or expense in one period, but they are never items of tax (or book) revenue or expense. They are either nontaxable revenues (book revenues that are nontaxable) or nondeductible expenses (book expenses that are nondeductible). Examples of permanent differences are (nontaxable) interest revenue on municipal bonds and (nondeductible) goodwill (GW) amortization expense under the purchase method for acquisitions. A good example of GW amortization is when one company purchases another company or any asset at a price that exceeds its recorded book value. This would be recognized partially at the time of purchase and partially over a period of time using standard amortization schedules. These are often referred to non-cash items of expenses or revenues and again are heavily scrutinized by analysts.\n\nCalculating Income Tax Expense, Income Taxes Payable, Deferred Tax Assets, and Deferred Tax Liabilities\r\nWe'll explain this concept by example:\n\r\nCompany ABC purchased a machine for $2m with a salvage value of $200,000.

A bond is essentially an IOU or promise to pay a predetermined annual or semiannual interest payment and to pay back the principal (face value) when the bond matures. When a company issues a bond with coupon payments that are equal to the current market rate, the bond is said to be issued at par. From an accounting point of view this means that if a company issues a $1M bond at par the company will in return have raised $1M in capital for its efforts. When bonds are issued with coupon payments that are not equal to the current market interest rate they are considered to be issued at a \"premium\" or \"discount\" to or from par. Companies that are very active in bond issuance issue bonds at par more frequently than those companies that are not as active.\n\nExample of bonds issued at a discount: \r\nCompany ABC issues a bond that will pay 9% a year for five years and similar bonds trading are paying currently paying 10%.While there are multiple market related factors that determine the issuing price (supply and demand, credit ratings, analysts' opinions, state of the economy and yield curve characteristics) in this simplistic example the bonds would most like be issued at a discount to its par value to compensate for the lower coupon payments. The company will ultimately get less money for its bond than the stated par value and is said to sell at a discount.\n\nExample of bonds issued at a premium:\r\nCompany ABC issues a bond that will pay 10% a year for five years and similar bonds are currently paying 9%. The only way the company will sell this bond to investors is if the company sells the bond at a premium to its par value (for more money) to compensate the company for the paying a higher coupon. The company will ultimately get more money for its bond than the stated par value, and the bond is said to sell at a premium.\n\r\nFrom an accounting standpoint, a company that sells a bond at a discount (or premium) will record on a cash basis a smaller interest payment but in reality will have a higher interest expense because it received fewer dollars for its bond. In accordance with the matching principle, premium and discounts must be amortized over the life of the bond. U.S. GAAP allows companies to amortize premiums or discounts by using a straight-line amortization or the effective interest rate method.\n\nDiscount vs. Premium Pricing\n\nIf coupon = to market rate, the bond is issued at par.\n\nIf coupon > market rate, the bond is issued at a premium. The issuing company will get more money at initiation than it will pay to investors at maturity. In exchange it will pay a higher coupon than it would have to if the bond was issued at par.\n\nIf coupon < market rate, the bond is issued at a discount. The issuing company will get less money at initiation than it will pay to investors at maturity. In exchange it will pay a lower coupon than it would have to if the bond was issued at par.\n        \n        \n            \n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_191", "text": "\n\nWe will now discuss the journal entries and accounting impact of bonds issued at par, a premium, or a discount.\n\r\nThe market value of a bond is calculated as follows:\n\n\n\n\nFormula 9.1\n\nMarket value of a bond = PV of coupon payments + PV of principal\n\n\n\n\n\nPar-value bonds\nCompany ABC issues a $1m bond that will pay a 10% semiannual (coupon) for five years and similar bonds are paying 10%.\n\nMarket value = $1m\nFace value or principal or book value = $1m\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBond issued at a Premium\nCompany ABC issues a $1m bond that will pay a 11% semiannual (coupon) for five years and similar bonds are paying 10%.

They can be retired, or if they are convertible bonds, they can be converted to another form of securities such as common stock.\n\nIf a company retires a bond prior to maturity, the stated book value (or carry value for a discount or premium bond) will most likely be the same as market value for which the company repurchased the bond.

Under SFAS 14 the convertible feature of a bond is completely ignored when the bond is issued, and it is considered only when it is converted into equity. The effect of a conversion of a bond into common stock is a decrease in liabilities for the carrying value of the bond and an increase in stockholders' equity for an amount equal to the bond carrying value. Gains or losses on bond conversion are not recognized. Any difference between the carrying value of the bond converted and the par value of the new shares issued is recorded in the account called \"contributed capital in excess of par value\". The market value of the common stock is ignored.\n\nExample: Bondholders converted $20,000 worth of convertible bonds into the issuer's $5-par common stock. Each $1,000 bond is can be converted into 10 shares of common stock. The carrying value of the bonds at the time of conversion is $21,500.\n\n\nFirst we need to compute the carrying value of the bonds converted\nCarrying value = bonds payable + bond premium = $20,000 + $1,500 = $21,500\n\n\nThen we calculate the number of bonds converted\nNumber of bonds converted = $20,000/$1000 = 20 bonds\n\n\nThen we calculate the number common shares to be issued?\nNumber of common shares = 20 bonds * 10 shares = 200 common shares\n\n\nThen we calculate the contributed capital in excess of par value\nContributed capital in excess of par value = carrying value of the bond - par value of the new shares = 21,500 - (200*$5) = $20,500\n\nJournal entry:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_194", "text": "\n\nMortgages payable\r\nA mortgage is a long-term debt secured by a real estate property such as a building or land. The mortgage is usually paid back in equal installments. These installments include a portion that is attributable to interest expense and the other to capital repayment.\n\nLong-term leases\r\nCompanies generally acquire the right to use an asset by purchasing it outright. But in some cases companies can lease an asset as opposed to an outright purchase. Leases can be classified as operating leases or capital leases. Operating leases are defined as short-term leases by which the company enters into an agreement with the lessor to use the asset for a portion of the asset's economic life. The lessee (the company leasing the equipment) will have no obligation to purchase the asset in the future. Capital leases, on the other hand, are long-term leases that create a long-term obligation for the lessee. If the asset qualifies as a capital lease, the asset is recorded on the balance sheet and the present value of the lease obligations are also recorded on the balance sheet. The asset is amortized over the life of the lease by using a straight-line depreciation method. Each rental payment includes a portion that is allocated to interest expenses and repayment of principal.\n\nPensions\r\nA pension plan is a qualified retirement plan set up by a corporation, labor union, government or other organization for its employees. A pension plan is an agreement under which the employer agrees to pay monetary benefits to employees once their period of active service has come to an end. A third party frequently manages the pension plan.\n\n\n\n\n\nLook Out!\r\n\t\t\t\tThe CFA institute concentrates on two types of pension plans: defined-benefit plans and defined-contribution plans. \n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n\t\tA defined-benefit pension plan promises a specific benefit at retirement to its employees. Since the benefits are defined, the employer is responsible for accumulating sufficient funds. Such plans insulate employees from investments that perform poorly, but it also prevents them from enjoying the entire upside potential of the pension if it does well.\n\r\n\t\tThat said, pension funds are governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), a more conservative investment approach, and large gains are unlikely to occur. Corporations refrain from setting up these types of plans because they can create enormous pension liabilities for a company if the pension's portfolio does not perform well.\n\r\n\t\tDefined pension plans need to be revalued periodically by an actuary. Under SFAS 87, companies are required to use the same actuarial cost method and are required to disclose assumptions about the pension obligation and pension cost. The major issue with SFAS 87 is that a company may make pension contributions using different assumptions when valuing the present value of the underlying assets using capital market assumptions.\n\n\r\n\t\tA defined-contribution pension plan, by contrast, specifies how much the employer will contribute annually. The actual amount the employee will receive at retirement will depend on the overall performance of the pension fund. With such a plan, investments that perform poorly mean lower income in retirement, and vice versa. Under this plan the company does not carry any risk and does not create any pension liabilities if it pays its annual contribution amount. Contributions made are simply expenses on an annual basis and are usually discretionary.\n\n\nAccounting for pension funds. To be able to pay their pension obligations, companies must accumulate funds known as the \"plan assets\". Plan assets are not formally recognized on the balance sheet, but are actively monitored in the employer's informal records. The plan assets can change due to returns on plan assets - such as dividends, interest, market-price appreciation and cash contributions - employer contributions and retiree benefits paid, which are benefits actually paid to retired employees. The composition of pension expenses is beyond this problem set.\n\n\n\n\n\nLook Out!\r\n\t\t\t\tCandidates should know that pension expenses are deducted from the income statement.\n\n\n\n\r\nThough the pension plan assets and liabilities are not included in the financial statement, companies are required to include the following information in the footnotes:\n\n\r\n\t\tThe components of the annual pension expense\n\r\n\t\tThe projected benefit obligation (as well as the accumulated benefit obligation and vested benefit obligation)\n\r\n\t\tOther information that makes it possible for interested analysts to reconstruct the financial statements with pension assets and liabilities included.\n\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_195", "text": "\n\nPost-retirement benefits include all retiree health and welfare benefits other than pensions and can include:\n\n\nMedical Coverage\n\nDental coverage\n\nLife insurance\n\nGroup legal services\n\nThese benefits are much more difficult to estimate than pension obligations. Under SFAS 106, employers have some latitude in making these estimates. The expected post-retirement benefit obligation is computed by taking the present value of expected post-retirement benefits. \n\nAccounting for post-retirement benefits\n\n\nAccounting for post-retirement benefits is, to the extent it is possible, the same as for pension benefits. \n\nWhile the accounting methods are similar, the latitude described above is due to the dynamic nature of these types of benefits in general. For example, pension fund accounting uses industry standard actuarial assumptions, discount rates and long-term market assumptions. While the treatment of pension funds is quite mature, methods under SFAS 106 are evolving and the expected future costs of these benefits are more fluid.\n\nThe main difference from an accounting perspective is that post-retirement healthcare benefits usually are \"all-or-nothing\" plans in which a certain level of coverage is promised upon retirement, and the coverage is independent of the length of service beyond the eligibility date. Cost is unrelated to service and is attributed to the years from the employee's date of hire to the full-eligibility date. \n\nElements of post-retirement benefit cost:\n\n\nService cost\n\nInterest cost\n\nReturn on plan assets\n\nAmortization and deferral \n\nAmortization of unrecognized prior service cost\n\nAmortization of transition asset and liability \n\nSFAS 106 permits the amortization of the transition liability over 20 years, versus the average remaining service period of active employment found under pension plans. \n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_196", "text": "\nBonds Issued at Par - Effects On:\n\n\nIncome statement - The income statement will include an interest expense equal to the bond's coupon payment attributable to the specified accounting period.\n\nBalance sheet - The balance sheet will include at all times a long-term liability equal to the face value of the bond until its maturity or redemption.\n\nCash flow statement - Going forward, cash flow from operations will include the interest expense recorded on the income statement.

In this example, the asset was depreciated using the straight-line depreciation method, or $16,849 ($84,247/5). \n\n\nOn the other hand, the lease obligation is reduced by the principal-repayment amount during each specified accounting period. \n\nThis interest component is determined by multiplying the beginning-period lease value with the discount rate used in the determination of the PV of the lease obligation. \n\nSince the lease obligation decreases with time, it is highest in the first year and declines over time. \n\nThat said, the principal repayment on the lease liability is determined by subtracting the interest component for the specified period with the actual lease payment to the lessor. \n\nAs a result, the principal-repayment amount increases with time and is lowest in the first year.\n\n\n\n\n\nLook Out!\r\n\t\t\t\tAt the end of the lease, both the lease obligation will be eliminated and so will the asset value.\n\n\n\n\n2) Income Statement Effect:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder a capital lease, operating expenses include the depreciable portion of the leased asset, and the interest portion is classified as a non-operating expense and is included in earnings before tax. \n\n\nAs noted earlier, the interest expense that emerges from capital leases is highest in the first years and decreases over time (unlike depreciation expense, which is constant). \n\nThis creates a variation in a company's reported total expenses. In the earlier years, a company using a capital lease will report a lower net income than a company using an operating lease. \n\nThis will also create a tax benefit for the company that uses a capital lease in the first years. \n\nThis tax benefit will cancel out because in the later years, the interest component will decrease and reported income will increase.\n\n3) Cash Flow Statement Impact:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCash flow statements remain unaffected by the choice of classifying leases as operating or capital leases. That said, cash flow from operations will include only the interest portion of the capital-lease obligation. The principal repayment on the lease obligation payment will be included as a cash outflow from cash flow from financing activities. As a result, capital leases will overstate CFO by the amount included in CFF and understate CFF.\n\nSummary of Financial Effects:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImpacts on Key Financial Ratios:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_202", "text": "\n        A sale and leaseback constitutes an arrangement where the seller of an asset leases back the same asset from the purchaser.\n\r\nThe lease arrangement is made immediately after the sale of the asset with the amount of the payments and the time period specified. Essentially, the seller of the asset becomes the lessee and the purchaser becomes the lessor in this arrangement.\n\r\nA leaseback arrangement is useful when companies need to untie the cash invested in an asset for other investments, but the asset is still needed in order to operate. Leaseback deals can also provide the seller with additional tax deductions. The lessor benefits in that they will receive stable payments for a specified period of time.\n\n\nUnder both U.S. and IASB GAAP:\r\n\t\tWhen the lease is capitalized, SFAS 13 (US GAAP) and IAS 17 (IASB GAAP) require the lessee to defer any gain on the sale of the asset. The gain would then be recognized over the life of the lease.\n\nUnder IAS 17 only:\r\n\t\tGains on sale and leasebacks of assets are recognized immediately should the lease be classified as operating.\n\nUnder SFAS 13 only:\r\n\t\tGains on sale and leaseback of assets must by amortized over the life of the lease.\n\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_203", "text": "\n\nMany economic transactions and events are not recognized in the financial statements because they do not qualify as accounting assets or transactions under GAAP standards. That said, these unreported assets and liabilities have real cash flow consequences. As a result, it is important to be able to identify and qualify these assets and liabilities.\n\n\nOperating lease - Classifying a lease as an operating lease provides a company with the opportunity to utilize the leased asset and assume a contractual obligation to pay the lessor during a specific period of time without having to report the asset and, more importantly, the liability. \n\nTake-or-pay contract - This is an agreement between a buyer and seller in which the buyer will still pay some amount even if the product or service is not provided. Companies use take-or-pay contracts to ensure that their vendor makes the materials, such as raw materials, that they need to sustain operations available to them. In the event that a company does not purchase the material from the vendor, the company will have to pay some amount to the vendor. This provides a company with the ability to acquire the use of an asset without having to record it as an asset and a liability. These arrangements are common in the natural-gas, chemical, paper and metal industry. \n\nThroughput arrangements - Natural-gas companies use throughput arrangements with pipelines or processors to ensure distribution or processing. The effects are the same as take-or-pay contracts.\n\nCommodity-linked bonds - Natural-resource companies may also finance inventory purchases through commodity-indexed debt where interest and/or principal repayments are a function of the price of the underling commodity. \n\nThe sale of accounts receivables - A company may sell its receivables to an unrelated third party to reduce its debt and improve its financial position. Most sales of receivables provide the buyer with a limited recourse to the seller. However, the recourse provision is generally well above the expected loss ratio on the receivables (allowance for doubtful accounts). The potential liability associated with the buyer-recourse provision is not displayed on the balance sheet. \n\nA more elaborate sale of account receivables is a parent company selling its receivables to a finance subsidiary where the parent owns less than 50% of the subsidiary. If the parent owns less than 50%, the financial asset and liability of the subsidiary are not included in the parent balance sheet; only the investment in the subsidiary is recorded as an asset. (If less than 50%, the equity method is used). Furthermore, the parent generally supports the subsidiary borrowings through extensive income-maintenance agreements and direct and indirect guarantees of debt. \n\n\nJoint ventures - Companies may enter into a joint venture with a supplier or other company. To obtain financing for such a venture, companies often enter into a take-or-pay or throughput contract with minimum payments designed to meet the venture's debt-service requirements. Furthermore, direct or indirect guarantees may be present. Generally, companies account their investments in joint ventures using the equity method since no single company holds a controlling interest. As a result, the balance sheet reports on the net investment in the venture. \n\nInvestments - Some companies issue long-term debt that is exchangeable for common shares of another publicly-traded company. Since the debt is secured by another liquid asset, the interest expense on the loan is usually smaller. \n\nThis issuance is also used by companies with a large capital-gain liability on stock held. The company's biggest concern in this case would be the large capital-gains tax liability they would have to pay should they default on the loan and have to exchange the debt for the securities it holds.\n\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_204", "text": "\n\n\nTake-or-pay contracts and throughput agreements\nThese types of agreements effectively allow companies to keep some operation assets and liabilities off the balance sheet. As a result, in the analysis of a company's financial statement, the balance sheet should be restated and include the present value of the minimum future payments to both the assets and liabilities section of the balance sheet. If this is not done, the debt-to-equity and asset-turnover ratio will be overstated.\n\nSales of receivables\nSales of receivables artificially reduce the receivables and short-term borrowing needs. Furthermore, they distort the pattern of cash flow from operations as the firm receives cash earlier than it would if the receivables had been collected in due course. \n\nIn addition, the potential liability associated with the buyer-recourse provision is not displayed on the balance sheet. From an analytical point of view, the current-asset ratio, working capital and receivable turnover will be overstated.\n\nOn the other hand, the leverage ratios such as debt-to-equity will be too high. The reported income will also be too high because if it did not sell its receivables, the company would have had to borrow the funds it acquired from the sale of the receivables to finance its current operations.\n\nAnalysts should adjust the balance sheet by adding back the amount of accounts receivables sold and increase short-term borrowing by an equal amount. Furthermore, the income statement needs to be restated and include the interest expense that would have been incurred by the firm had it not sold its receivables and borrowed the money instead. \n\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_205", "text": "\n\nA lessor (the leasing company) can account for a lease in three ways:\n\n\nOperating lease\n\nDirect-financing lease\n\nSales-type lease\n\nLease capitalization, which includes the direct-financing lease and the sales-type lease, needs to be recognized when a lease meets any one of the four criteria specified for capitalization of leases and both of the following revenues-recognition criteria: \n\n\nCollection of the monthly lease payments is reasonably predictable.\n\nLessor's performance is substantially complete, or future costs are reasonably predictable.\n\nIf the lease is accounted for as a capital lease, the lessor must determine if it classifies as a direct-finance lease or as a sales-type lease. To classify as a sales-type lease, the fair value of the asset must be greater than the lessor's book value. If not, it is accounted for as a direct-financing lease.\n\nDirect-Financing Lease\nAs its name implies, a direct-financing lease is basically the coupling of a sale and financing transaction. In this case, the lessor removes the leased asset from its books and replaces it with a receivable from the lessee.\n\nThe only income recognized by the lessor is the interest received. The implied rate is taken by calculating IRR of the asset; cash inflow is equal to lease payments and cash outflow is equal to the book value of the lease asset. \n\nSales-Type Lease\nA sales-type lease is accounted for like a direct-financing lease, except that profit on a sale is recognized upon inception of the lease, in addition to the interest income recognized during the lease term. The gross profit recognized at the inception of the lease is the PV of all lease payments minus the cost of the leased asset. \n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_206", "text": "\n\nWe conclude our five chapter discussion on financial statements with a brief yet important chapter on red flags. Although companies are required to follow generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), some companies find loopholes and ways to manipulate their numbers. Part of the SOX concept is to have those who create and sign off on financial statements be held responsible for misrepresentation.\nThese items are crucial for analysts to recognize in order to avoid recommending poor investments to their clients. Prime examples from the last decade were some bad apples like Enron and Worldcom.\nThe following articles are great resources on spotting the signs of earnings manipulation, learning telltale signs of corporate misdeeds, and how off-balance sheet entities can be misleading:\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCooking the Books\nPutting Management Under the Microscope\nOff-Balance-Sheet Entities: The Good, the Bad and the Ugly \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_207", "text": "\n\r\nUnder U.S. GAAP, a company's management is given some discretion as to the timing and classification of certain items. Unfortunately, a company's management can use this allotted discretion to manipulate reported earnings.\n\nTypes of Earnings Manipulation\n\r\n1. Classification of good news/bad news \u2013 Since analysts and investors tend to focus on income from continuing operations, a reporting company will tend to include good news in this category and keep bad news out (report it below the net-income-from-operations line). If a company sells a subsidiary for a gain, it will most likely be included in the net income from continuing operations. If the company sells the subsidiary for a loss, the company will most likely want to classify it as a discontinued operation (extraordinary or unusual or infrequent event) and report the loss below the line.\n\n2. Income Smoothing \u2013 Companies go through cycles of good years and bad years. During the good years some companies will create accounting reserves so when they are no longer doing well, they can increase their net income and effectively smooth out their reported net income over time. Income smoothing can be classified as one of two types:\n\na. Inter-temporal smoothing takes place when a company alters the timing of expenditures or chooses an accounting method that smoothes out earnings. One example is choosing to capitalize or expense R&D expenditures.\n\nb. Classification smoothing occurs when a company chooses the category of an item based on the reporting implication it will have (i.e. it will be above or below the net-income-from-continuing-operations line). An example is the selling of a subsidiary or asset as if it were a gain or loss from continuing operations or not.\n\n3. Big-Bath Behavior - This often takes place when a company is having what they think their investors will interpret as a really bad year and their previous income reserves are not enough to offset the bad results they are about to report. Management knows that its stock will drop because of this news, and investors will not be happy. As a result, management figures that it is the best time to get rid of all of the inconsistencies that will have a negative impact on the financial statements (impairment of assets etc.). This will create two benefits for a company: first, most of the bad news will be reported below the line, and second, in the future the company will appear to be more profitable than in the past.\n\n4. Accounting Changes \u2013 A company can change its accounting methods, such as change its inventory-accounting methodology (LIFO to FIFO), capitalize instead of expense decisions and change its depreciation methodology. Since accounting changes are accounted for below the line (net income from operations), they can be used to manipulate the reported income from continuing operations.\n        \n        \n            \n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_208", "text": "\n\nShenanigan Strategies\r\nFinancial shenanigans are actions or omissions (tricks) intended to hide or distort the real financial performance or financial condition of an entity. They range from minor deceptions to more serious misapplications of accounting principles.\n\r\nThere are two basic strategies underlying accounting shenanigans:\r\n\n\nInflating current reported income - A company can inflate its current income by inflating current revenues and gains, or deflating current expenses.\n\nDeflating current reported income - A company can deflate current revenues by deflating current revenues or gains, or inflating current expenses.\n\r\nShenanigans aimed at inflating current reported income are considered more serious, because they make the company look much better than it is. Furthermore, over time, the inflation of current income will most likely be discovered in the future and will make the company stock plummet. On the other hand, deflating current reported income will only serve as an income-smoothing mechanism and will not have as serious of an impact on common shareholders.\n\nMethods of Inflating or Deflating Income\n\r\nStretching out payables:\r\n\n\r\n\t\tThis is one of the easiest methods to inflate income while reducing costs and one of the most difficult to spot.\n\r\n\t\tBasically the company picks and chooses some or all of its payables and instead of recording them in the current period they extend the payables to a future period.\n\r\nFinancing of payables:\r\n\n\r\n\t\tSimilar to stretching out payables, a company may choose to finance a portion of their payables so they can record the smaller interest expense instead of the principle amount of the payable as an expense.\n\r\nSecuritization of receivables:\r\n\n\r\n\t\tJust like the decision to securitize a leasing agreement, a company may attempt to securitize their receivables with similar effects\n\r\n\t\tInstead of recognizing the receivables when they should be reported, securitizing them will give the company the ability to manipulate their reported earnings though an amortization schedule that will have lower interest costs in the earlier years.\n\r\nUsing stock buybacks to offset dilution of earnings:\r\n\n\r\n\t\tWhile many investors may welcome a company's decision to buyback shares, others may not.\n\r\n\t\tThe immediate effects of a share buyback is to reduce the dilution of earnings by reducing the number of shares outstanding.\n\r\n\t\tThis allows the company to report future earnings in relation to less shares outstanding with multiple positive looking effects; higher reported EPS, potentially lowering a company's p/e ratio (among other ratios) and potentially increasing the company's share price.\n\nOther Shenanigans for investors to look out for:\n\nRecording revenues prematurely and/or of questionable quality, such as:\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\tRecording revenues when a substantial portion of the service has not been delivered\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\tRecording revenues of unshipped items\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\tRecording revenues of items that have not yet been accepted by the client\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\tRecording revenues of items for which the client has no obligation to pay (consignment)\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\tRecording sales that were made to an affiliate\n\n\nRecording fictional revenues:\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\tRecording sales for no reason\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\tMisclassifying income from investments as revenue\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\tRecording the cash received from a lending transaction as revenue\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\tRecording supplier rebates as revenues\n\n\nCreating special transactions or one-time transactions to generate a gain, such as:\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\tSelling undervalued assets for a profit\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\tSelling investments for a gain and recording it as revenue, or using it to reduce current operating expenses\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\tReclassifying certain balance sheet accounts to create income\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\tFailure to record unearned revenues (customer prepayments) and recording these amounts as revenues\n\n\nDeferring current revenues to a future period, such as:\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\tRefraining from recording revenues before a merger or acquisition\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\tIncreasing allowance for bad debt\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\tIncreasing other reserves such as warranties and returns\n\n\nRecognizing future expenses in current expenses as a special one-time charge, such as:\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\tInflating one-time charges\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\tIncreasing expenses such as R&D, advertising, etc.\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\tRecognizing expenses that will continue to provide the company with a future economic benefit, such advertising, R&D and maintenance expenses, among others.\n\n\n\nAggressive Accounting Policies\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\tIncreasing the useful file of an asset beyond its estimated useful life\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\tUsing FIFO versus average cost or LIFO\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\tAccruing losses associated with contingencies\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\tCapitalizing all software development and R&D costs, or aggressively capitalizing any costs\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\tAmortizing costs slowly thus reducing recognized expenses\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\tRecording investment income as revenue\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\tNot accounting for or allocating a small amount for returns, warranties, allowance for bad debt and allowance for doubtful accounts\n\n\n\r\nDescribe the accounting warning signs related to the Enron accounting scandal.\r\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\tExtensive use of off-balance-sheet financing (joint ventures, improperly classifying leases and take-or-pay and throughput contracts).\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\tPurposely providing non-transparent financial statements.\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\tUse of a \"merchant model\" of recording trading revenues where instead of the reporting the trading fees as income they chose to record the entire trade as income not accounting for the corresponding cost of the asset being traded.\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\tA wide scale cooperation: while many of the leading levels of management claimed to have no knowledge of less than honest accounting practices, the final outcomes proved that this could not have been undertaken by just one person.\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\tPresenting inflated assets and undervalued liabilities by taking some to \"off balance sheet\" methods.

A conflict, known as an \"agency problem\", arises when there is a conflict of interest between the needs of the principal and the needs of the agent. \n\nIn finance, the two primary agency relationships that exist are between:\nManagers and stockholders\nManagers and creditors\n\n1. Stockholders versus Managers\n\n\nIf the manager owns less than 100% of the firm's common stock, a potential agency problem between mangers and stockholders exists. \n\nManagers, at times, may make decisions that have the potential to be in conflict with the best interests of the shareholders. For example, managers may grow their firm to escape a takeover attempt to increase their own job security. However, a takeover may be in the shareholders' best interest.\n\n2. Stockholders versus Creditors\n\n\nCreditors decide to loan money to a corporation based on the riskiness of the company, its capital structure and its potential capital structure. All of these factors will affect the company's potential cash flow, which is the main concern of creditors. \n\nStockholders, however, have control of such decisions through the managers. \n\nSince stockholders will make decisions based on their best interest, a potential agency problem exists between the stockholders and creditors. For example, managers could borrow money to repurchase shares to lower the corporation's share base and increase shareholder return. Stockholders will benefit; however, creditors will be concerned given the increase in debt that would affect future cash flows. \n\n\nMotivating Managers to Act in Shareholder's Best Interest \nFour primary mechanisms are used to motivate managers to act in stockholders' best interests:\n\n\nManagerial compensation \n\nDirect intervention by stockholders \n\nThreat of firing \n\nThreat of takeovers\n\n\n1. Managerial Compensation\nManagerial compensation should be constructed not only to retain competent managers, but to align managers' interests with those of stockholders as much as possible. \n\n\nThis is typically done with an annual salary plus performance bonuses and company shares. \n\nCompany shares are typically distributed to managers either as:\n\n\nPerformance shares, where managers will receive a certain number shares based on the company's performance.\n\nExecutive stock options, which allow the manager to purchase shares at a future date and price. With the use of stock options, managers are aligned closer to the interest of the stockholders as they themselves will be stockholders.\n\n\n\n2. Direct Intervention by Stockholders\nToday, the majority of a company's stock is owned by large institutional investors, such as mutual funds and pensions. As such, these large institutional stockholders have the ability to exert influence on mangers and, as a result, the firm's operations.\n\n3. Threat of Firing\nIf stockholders are unhappy with current management, they can encourage the existing board of directors to change the existing management, or stockholders may even re-elect a new board of directors that will accomplish the task.\n\n4. Threat of Takeovers\nIf a stock price deteriorates because of management's inability to run the company effectively, competitors or stockholders may take a controlling interest in the company and bring in their own managers.\n\r\nTo learn more about governance, please see the article, Governance Pays.\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_213", "text": "\n\nWhat is Capital Budgeting?\r\nCapital budgeting is defined as the process of planning for projects on assets with cash flows of a period greater than one year.\n\r\nThese projects can be classified as:\n\r\n\u00b7 Replacement decisions to maintain the business\r\n\u00b7 Existing product or market expansion\r\n\u00b7 New products and services\r\n\u00b7 Regulatory, safety and environmental\r\n\u00b7 Other, including pet projects or difficult to evaluate projects\n\r\nAdditionally, projects can also be classified as mutually exclusive or independent:\n- Mutually exclusive projects indicate there is only one project among all possible projects that can be accepted.\n- Independent projects are potential projects that are unrelated, and any combination of those projects can be accepted.\n\nThe Importance of Capital Budgeting\r\nCapital budgeting is important for many reasons:\r\n- Since projects approved via capital budgeting are long term, the firm becomes tied to the project and loses some of its flexibility during that period.\r\n- When making the decision to purchase an asset, managers need to forecast the revenue over the life of that asset.\r\n- Lastly, given the length of the projects, capital-budgeting decisions ultimately define the strategic plan of the company.\n\r\nFor more on capital budgeting, check out our basic tutorial.\n        \n        \n            \n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_214", "text": "\nThe following sections discuss the cost of capital in terms of its components, calculations, and company internal targets. Readers should know the costs that make up the weighted cost of capital (WACC). \n\nInterpreting the Cost of Capital\nGiven the importance of capital budgeting, a company should use the weighted average of the costs of the various types of capital it may use in financing its operations. \n\nA company uses debt, common equity and preferred equity to fund new projects, typically in large sums. In the long run, companies typically adhere to target weights for each of the sources of funding. When a capital budgeting decision is being made, it is important to keep in mind how the capital structure may be affected.\n\nCost Components\nA company's weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is comprised of the following costs:\n1.Cost of debt\n2.Cost of preferred stock\n3.Cost of retained earnings\n4.Cost of external equity\n\n1. Cost of Debt \nIn the WACC calculation, the after-tax cost of debt is used. Using the after-tax cost takes into account the tax savings from the tax-deductibility of interest.\n\nThe after-tax cost of debt can be calculated as follows:\n\nFormula 11.1\n\n\n\n\nAfter-tax cost of debt = kd (1-t)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLook Out!\r\n\t\t\t\tIt is important to note that kd represents thecost to issue new debt, not the firm\\'s existing debt. \n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Cost of Debt\nNewco plans to issue debt at a 7% interest rate.

Cost of Preferred Stock\nCost of preferred stock (kps) can be calculated as follows:\n\nFormula 11.2\n\n\n\n\nkps = Dps/Pnet\n\nwhere:\nDps = preferred dividends\nPnet = net issuing price\n\n\n\nExample: Cost of preferred stock\nAssume Newco's preferred stock pays a dividend of $2 per share and it sells for $100 per share. If the cost to Newco to issue new shares is 4%, what is Newco's cost of preferred stock?\n\nAnswer:\nkps = Dps/Pnet = $2/$100(1-0.04) = 2.1% \n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_215", "text": "\n\n3. Cost of retained earnings\r\nCost of retained earnings (ks) is the return stockholders require on the company's common stock. \n\nThere are three methods one can use to derive the cost of retained earnings:\na) Capital-asset-pricing-model (CAPM) approach\nb) Bond-yield-plus-premium approach \nc) Discounted cash flow approach\n\na) CAPM Approach \nTo calculate the cost of capital using the CAPM approach, you must first estimate the risk-free rate (rf), which is typically the U.S. Treasury bond rate or the 30-day Treasury-bill rate as well as the expected rate of return on the market (rm). \n\nThe next step is to estimate the company's beta (bi), which is an estimate of the stock's risk. Inputting these assumptions into the CAPM equation, you can then calculate the cost of retained earnings.\n\nFormula 11.3 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: CAPM approach\nFor Newco, assume rf = 4%, rm = 15% and bi = 1.1. What is the cost of retained earnings for Newco using the CAPM approach?\n\nAnswer:\nks = rf + bi (rm - rf) = 4% + 1.1(15%-4%) = 16.1%\n\nb) Bond-Yield-Plus-Premium Approach\nThis is a simple, ad hoc approach to estimating the cost of retained earnings. Simply take the interest rate of the firm's long-term debt and add a risk premium (typically three to five percentage points): \n\nFormula 11.4\n\n\n\n\n\nks = long-term bond yield + risk premium\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: bond-yield-plus-premium approach\nThe interest rate on Newco's long-term debt is 7% and our risk premium is 4%. What is the cost of retained earnings for Newco using the bond-yield-plus-premium approach?\n\nAnswer: \nks = 7% + 4% = 11%\n\nc) Discounted Cash Flow ApproachAlso known as the \"dividend yield plus growth approach\".

Discounted Payback Period\nThe one issue we mentioned with the payback period is that it does not take into account the time value of money, but the discounted payback period does.The discounted payback period discounts each of the estimated cash flows and then determines the payback period from those discounted flows.\nExample: discounted payback period\nUsing our last example above, determine the discounted payback period for Machine A and Machine B, and determine which project Newco should accept.

Since the NPVB > NPVA, Newco should choose the project for Machine B.\n\nInternal Rate of Return \nThe internal rate of return (IRR)\u00a0on a project is the rate of return at which the projects NPV equals zero. At this point, a project's cash flows are equal to the project's costs. Similar to how management must establish a maximum payback period, management must also set what is known as a \"hurdle rate\", the minimum rate of return a company will accept for a project.\n\nWhen a project is reviewed with a hurdle rate in mind, the greater the IRR is above the hurdle rate, the greater the NPV, and conversely, the further the IRR is below the hurdle rate, the lower the NPV.\n\n\n\n\n\nLook Out!\nFor the IRR, the decision rules are as follows:\nIf IRR > hurdle rate, accept the project\nIf IRR< hurdle rate, reject the project\n\n\n\n\nFor a project to be accepted, the IRR must be greater than or equal to the hurdle rate.

Because the $10,000 in annual depreciation is not an actual cash outflow, the $20,000 in accounting net income is not the true cash flow to the firm. \nIf, while all else is constant, annual depreciation were to decline by $5,000 to $5,000, accounting net income would increase to $25,000, but actual cash flow would remain unchanged. However, calculations of net cash flow exclude the effects of depreciation. \n\nFormula 11.13\n\n\n\n\n\nFor purposes of capital budgeting,\nNet Cash Flow = Net Income + Depreciation\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer: Therefore, net cash flow would be equal to $30,000 ($20,000 net income +$10,000 depreciation) before the changes in depreciation and $30,000 ($25,000 net income + $5,000 depreciation) after the changes in depreciation.\u00a0\r\n\t\t\u00a0\n\nIncremental Cash Flow and Capital Budgeting\r\nOnce a company makes a decision to accept a project, an incremental cash flow is then the cash flow that is added to the firm's existing cash flow as a result of accepting a new project.\n\nHowever, in determining incremental cash flows from a new project, problems arise, such as:\n\n1. Sunk Costs\nThese are the initial outlays required to analyze a project that cannot be recovered even if a project is accepted. As such, these costs will not affect the future cash flows of the project and should not be considered when making capital-budgeting decisions. \n\nSuppose Newco is considering whether to make an addition to its current plant to increase production. To determine if the new addition is worthwhile, Newco hired a consulting firm for $50,000 to analyze the addition and the effect it will have on production. The $50,000 is considered a sunk cost. If the project is rejected, the $50,000 will still be paid, and if the project is accepted, the $50,000 will not affect the future cash flows of the addition.\n\n2. Opportunity Cost\nThis is the cost of not going forward with a project or the cash outflows that will not be earned as a result of utilizing an asset for another alternative. For example, the opportunity cost of Newco's new addition considered above is the cost of the land on which Newco is considering putting the new plant addition. As such, it should be included in the analysis of the project.\n\n3. Externality\nAdditionally, in the consideration of incremental cash flows of a new project, there may be effects on the existing operations of the company to consider, known as \"externalities\". For example, the addition to Newco's plant is for the purpose of producing a new product. It must be considered if the new product may actually take away or add to sales of the existing product. \n\n4. Cannibalization\nThis is the type of externality where the new project takes sales away from the existing product.\n\n\nChanges in Net Working Capital\nA change in net working capital is essentially the changes in current assets minus changes in current liabilities. Within the capital-budgeting process, a project typically adds to current assets given additional inventories or potential increases in accounts receivables from new sales. The increases to current assets, however, are offset by current liabilities needed to finance the new project. \n\nOverall, there may be change to net working capital from the new project. \n\n\n\nIf the change in net working capital is positive, the change to current assets outweighs the change in the current liabilities. \n\nIf, however, the change in net working capital is negative, the change to current liabilities outweighs the change in current assets.\n\n\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_224", "text": "\n\nWhile useful NPV and IRR methods are useful methods for determining whether to accept a project, both have their advantages and disadvantages. \n\nAdvantages:\n\n\nWith the NPV method, the advantage is that it is a direct measure of the dollar contribution to the stockholders.\n\nWith the IRR method, the advantage is that it shows the return on the original money invested.\n\n\nDisadvantages:\n\n\nWith the NPV method, the disadvantage is that the project size is not measured.\n\nWith the IRR method, the disadvantage is that, at times, it can give you conflicting answers when compared to NPV for mutually exclusive projects. The 'multiple IRR problem' can also be an issue, as discussed below. \n\n\r\n\t\u00a0\n\nThe Multiple IRR Problem\nA multiple IRR problem occurs when cash flows during the project lifetime is negative (i.e. the project operates at a loss or the company needs to contribute more capital). \n\nThis is known as a \"non-normal cash flow\", and such cash flows will give multiple IRRs. \n\nWhy Do NPV and IRR Methods Produce Conflicting Rankings?\nWhen a project is an independent project, meaning the decision to invest in a project is independent of any other projects, both the NPV and IRR will always give the same result, either rejecting or accepting a project. \n\nWhile NPV and IRR are useful metrics for analyzing mutually exclusive projects - that is, when the decision must be one project or another - these metrics do not always point you in the same direction. This is a result of the timing of cash flows for each project. In addition, conflicting results may simply occur because of the project sizes. \n\n\n\n\nLook Out!\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThe timing of cash flows as well as project sizes can produce conflicting results in the NPV and IRR methods.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: NPV and IRR Analysis\nAssume once again that Newco needs to purchase a new machine for its manufacturing plant. Newco has narrowed it down to two machines that meet its criteria (Machine A and Machine B), and now it has to choose one of the machines to purchase. Further, Newco has assumed the following analysis on which to base its decision:\n\nFigure 11.6: Potential Machines for Newco\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n\t\u00a0\n\nAnswer:\nWe first determine the NPV for each machine as follows:\n\nNPVA = ($5,000) + $2,768 + $2.553 = $321\n\nNPVB = ($10,000) + $5,350 + $5,106 = $456\n\nAccording to the NPV analysis alone, Machine B is the most appropriate choice for Newco to purchase.\n\nThe next step is to determine the IRR for each machine using our financial calculator. The IRR for Machine A is equal to 13%, whereas the IRR for Machine B is equal to 11%. \n\nAccording to the IRR analysis alone, Machine A is the most appropriate choice for Newco to purchase.\n\nThe NPV and IRR analysis for these two projects give us conflicting results. This is most likely due to the timing of the cash flows for each project as well as the size differential between the two projects.\n\nThe Post-Audit's Role\nThe post-audit process in the capital-budgeting process is quite important. In the post-audit process, an analyst examines a company's capital-budgeting decisions to see how the actual results from the projects compare to the results the company estimated. The post-audit process gives the company a sense of not only how the projects are performing, but also how good its inputs were. \n\nIf a project's actual results differed significantly in a negative direction, the post-audit process will help the company learn where it went wrong with respect to inputs so that the same mistake will not be made when analyzing future projects.\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_225", "text": "\n\nAs a primer, readers should remember that:\n\nExpansion projects are projects companies invest in to expand the earnings of its business. \n\nReplacement projects, are projects that companies invest in to replace old assets in order to maintain efficiencies.\n\nExample: NPV Analysis\nAssume Newco is planning to add new machinery to its current plant.

These cash flows can be segmented as follows:\n\n1. Initial Investment Outlay\nThese are the costs that are needed to start the project, such as new equipment, installation, etc.\n\n2. Operating Cash Flow over a Project's Life\nThis is the additional cash flow a new project generates. \n\n3. Terminal-Year Cash Flow\nThis is the final cash flow, both the inflows and outflows at the end of the project's life, such as potential salvage value at the end of a machine's life.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLook Out!\r\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is important to note that while interest expense is included in a company\\'s earnings per share, it is not included in operating cash flows as it is already in the discounting process.\n\n\n\n\r\n\t\u00a0\n\nExample: Expansion Project\nLet us begin with our previous example. Newco is looking to add to its production capacity and is looking closely at investing in Machine B. Machine B has a cost of $2,000, with shipping and installation expenses of $500 and $300 in net working capital. Newco expects the machine to last for five years, at which point Machine B will have a book value (BV) of $1,000 ($2,000 minus five years of $200 annual depreciation) and a potential market value of $800. \n\nWith respect to cash flows, Newco expects the new machine to generate an additional $1,500 in revenues and costs of $200.

Based on the current market, Newco can sell the old machine for $200, but this machine has a book value of $500. \n\nThe new machine Newco is looking to invest capital in has a cost of $2,000, with shipping and installation expenses of $500 and $300 in net working capital. Newco expects the machine to last for five years, at which point Machine B would have a book value of $1,000 ($2,000 minus five years of $200 annual depreciation) and a potential market value of $800. \n\nWith respect to cash flows, Newco expects the new machine to generate an additional $1,500 in revenues and costs of $200.

One reason for this potential problem is the timing of the cash flows of the mutually exclusive projects. As a result, we need to adjust for the timing issue in order to correct this problem. \n\nThere are two methods used to make the adjustments:\n\n\n1. Replacement-chain method\n\n2. Equivalent annual annuity\n\nExample:\nOnce again, assume Newco is planning to add new machinery to its current plant. There are two machines Newco is considering, with cash flows as follows:\n\nFigure 11.8: Discounted cash flows for Machine A and Machine B\n\n\n\nCompare the two projects with unequal lives using both the replacement-chain method and the equivalent annual annuity (EAA) approach.\n\n1. Replacement-Chain Method\nIn this example, Machine A has an operating lifespan of six years. Machine B has an operating lifespan of three years. The cash flows for each project are discounted by Newco's calculated WACC of 8.4%.\n\n\nNPV of Machine A is equal to $2,926. \n\nNPV of Machine B is equal to $1,735. \r\n\t\t\u00a0\n\n\nThe initial analysis indicates that Machine A, with the greater NPV, should be the project chosen. \n\n\nThe IRR of Machine A is equal to 8.3%. \n\nThe IRR of Machine B is equal to 15.5%.\r\n\t\t\u00a0\n\n\nThis analysis indicates that Machine B, with the greater IRR, should be the project chosen. \nThe NPV analysis and the IRR analysis have given us differing results. This is most likely due to the unequal lives of the two projects. As such, we need to analyze the two projects over a common life. \n\nFor Machine A (project 1), the lifespan is six years. For Machine B (project 2), the lifespan is three years. Given that the lifespan of the longest project is six years, in order to measure both over a common life, we must adjust the lifespan of Machine B to six years.\n\nBecause the lifespan of Machine B is three years, the lifespan of this project needs to be doubled to equal the six-year lifespan of Machine A. This indicates that another Machine B would have to be purchased (to get two machines with a lifespan of three years each) to get to the six-year lifespan of Machine A - hence, the replacement-chain method.\n\nThe new cash flows would be as follows: \n\nFigure 11.9: Cash flows over a common life\n\n\n\n\nNPV of Machine A remains $2,926.\n\nNPV of Machine B is now $3,098 given the adjustment.\n\nThe initial analysis indicates that Machine B, with the greater NPV, should be the project chosen. Recall, this is different from our first analysis where Machine A was chosen given its greater NPV.\n\n\nThe IRR of Machine A remains 8.3%. \n\nThe IRR of Machine B remains 15.5%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLook Out!\nNote, while the NPV has changed given the additional cash flows, the IRR for the projects remain the same.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis analysis indicates that Machine B, with the greater IRR, should be the project chosen. Recall, this is the same as our first analysis, where Machine B was chosen given its greater IRR.\n\r\nWith the cash flows adjusted with the replacement-chain method, both the NPV and the IRR arrive at the same conclusion. With this adjusted analysis, Machine B (project 2), should be the project accepted.\n\r\n2. Equivalent-Annual-Annuity Approach \r\nWhile easy to understand, the replacement-chain method can be time consuming. A simpler approach is the equivalent-annual-annuity approach.\n\r\nThis is the procedure for determining EAA:\n\r\n1) Determine the projects' NPVs.\r\n2) Find each project's EAA, the expected payment over the project's life, where the future value of the project would equal zero.\r\n3) Compare the EAA of each project and select the project with the highestEAA.\n\r\nFrom our example, the NPV of each project is as follows:\r\n-NPV of Machine A is equal to $2,926.\r\n-NPV of Machine B is equal to $1,735.\n\r\nTo determine each project's EAA, it is best to use your financial calculator.\n\r\n- For, Machine A (project 1), our assumptions are as follows:\n\r\ni = 8.4% (the company's WACC)\r\nn = 6\r\nPV = NPV = -2,926\r\nFV = 0\r\nFind PMT\n\r\nFor Machine A, the EAA (the calculated PMT) is $640.64.\n\r\n- For Machine B (project 2), our assumptions are as follows:\n\r\ni = 8.4% (the company's WACC)\r\nn = 3\r\nPV = NPV = -1,735\r\nFV = 0\r\nFind for PMT\n\r\nFor Machine B, the EAA (the calculated PMT) is $678.10.\n\nAnswer\r\nMachine B should be the project chosen as it has the highest EAA, which is $678.10, relative to Machine A whose EAA is $640.64.\n\nInflation Effects on Capital Budgeting Analysis\r\nInflation exists and should not be forgotten when making capital-budgeting decisions. It is important to build inflation expectations into the analysis. If inflation expectations are left out of the capital-budgeting analysis, the NPV calculated from the biased cash flows will be incorrect.\n\r\nAs an example, suppose Newco unintentionally leaves out its inflation expectations when determining the plant addition. Since inflation expectations are included in the WACC, and PV of each cash flow is discounted by the WACC, the NPV will be incorrect and have a downward bias.\r\n\u00a0\n        \n        \n            \n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_227", "text": "\n\n\nLike anything, projects do have risks. There are three types of project risks associated with capital budgeting:\u00a0\n\n1. Stand-Alone Risk \nThis risk assumes the project a company intends to pursue is a single asset that is separate from the company's other assets. It is measured by the variability of the single project alone. Stand-alone risk does not take into account how the risk of a single asset will affect the overall corporate risk.\n\n2. Corporate Risk\nThis risk assumes the project a company intends to pursue is not a single asset but incorporated with a company's other assets. As such, the risk of a project could be diversified away by the company's other assets. It is measured by the potential impact a project may have on the company's earnings.\n\n3. Market Risk\nThis looks at the risk of a project through the eyes of the stockholder. It looks at the project not only from a company's perspective, but from the stockholder's overall portfolio. It is measured by the effect the project may have on the company's beta.\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_228", "text": "\n\nIt is important to keep in mind that when a company analyzes a potential project, it is forecasting potential not actual cash flows for a project. As we all know, forecasts are based on assumptions that may be incorrect. It is therefore important for a company to perform a sensitivity analysis on its assumptions to get a better sense of the overall risk of the project the company is about to take. \n\nThere are three risk-analysis techniques that should be known for the exam:\n\n1. Sensitivity Analysis\nSensitivity analysis is simply the method for determining how sensitive our NPV analysis is to changes in our variable assumptions. To begin a sensitivity analysis, we must first come up with a base-case scenario. This is typically the NPV using assumptions we believe are most accurate. From there, we can change various assumptions we had initially made based on other potential assumptions. NPV is then recalculated, and the sensitivity of the NPV based on the change in assumptions is determined. Depending on our confidence in our assumptions, we can determine how potentially risky a project can be. \n\n2. Scenario Analysis\nScenario analysis takes sensitivity analysis a step further. Rather than just looking at the sensitivity of our NPV analysis to changes in our variable assumptions, scenario analysis also looks at the probability distribution of the variables. Like sensitivity analysis, scenario analysis starts with the construction of a base case scenario. From there, other scenarios are considered, known as the \"best-case scenario\" and the \"worst-case scenario\". Probabilities are assigned to the scenarios and computed to arrive at an expected value. Given its simplicity, scenario analysis is one the most frequently used risk-analysis techniques.\n\n3. Monte Carlo Simulation\nMonte Carlo simulation is considered to be the \"best\" method of sensitivity analysis. It comes up with infinite calculations (expected values) given a number of constraints. Constraints are added and the system generates random variables of inputs. From there, NPV is calculated. Rather than generating just a few iterations, the simulation repeats the process numerous times. From the numerous results, the expected value is then calculated.\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_229", "text": "\n\n\nThe security market line (SML) is simply a plot of expected returns of investments with respect to its beta, market risk. Expected values are calculated with the following equation:\n\nFormula 11.15\n\n\n\n\nEs = rf + Bs(Emkt - rf)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere:\r\n\t\t\trf = the risk-free rate\nBs = the beta of the investment\nEmkt = the expected return of the market \nEs = the expected return of the investment\n\n\n\nThe beta is thus the sensitivity of the investment to the market or current portfolio. It is the measure of the riskiness of a project. When taken in isolation, a project may be considered more or less risky than the current risk profile of a company. Through the use of the SML as a means to calculate a company's WACC, this risk profile would be accounted for.\n\nExample:\nWhen a new product line for Newco is considered, the project's beta is 1.5. Assuming the risk-free rate is 4% and the expected return on the market is 12%, compute the cost of equity for the new product line.\n\nAnswer:\nCost of equity = rf + Bs(Emkt - rf) = 4% + 1.5(12% - 4%) = 16%\n\nThe project's required return on retained earnings is thus 16% and should be used in our calculation of WACC.\n\nEstimating Beta\nIn risk analysis, estimating the beta of a project is quite important. But like many estimations, it can be difficult to determine. \n\nThe two most widely used methods of estimating beta are:\n\n1. Pure-Play Method\nWhen using the pure-play method, a company seeks out companies with a product line that is similar to the line for which the company is trying to estimate the beta. Once these companies are found, the company would then take an average of those betas to determine its project beta.\n\nSuppose Newco would like to add beer to its existing product line of soda. Newco is quite familiar with the beta of making soda given its history. However, determining the beta for beer is not as intuitive for Newco as it has never produced it.\n\nThus, to determine the beta of the new beer project, Newco can take the average beta of other beer makers, such as Anheuser Busch and Coors.\n\n2. Accounting-Beta Method\nWhen using the accounting-beta method, a company would run a regression using the company's return on assets (ROA) against the ROA for market benchmark, such as the S&P 500. The accounting beta is the slope coefficient of the regression. \n\nThe typical procedure for developing a risk-adjusted discount rate is as follows:\n\n1. A company first begins with its cost of capital for the firm.\r\n2. The cost of capital then must be adjusted for the riskiness of the project, by adjusting the company's cost of capital either up or down depending on the risk of the project relative to the firm. \n\nFor projects that are riskier, the company's WACC would be adjusted higher and if the project is less risky, the company's WACC is adjusted lower. The main issue in this procedure is that it is subjective. \n\nCapital Rationing\nEssentially, capital rationing is the process of allocating the company's capital among projects to maximize shareholder return. \n\nWhen making decisions to invest in positive net-present-value (NPV) projects, companies continue to invest until their marginal returns equal their marginal cost of capital. There are times, however, when a company may not have capital to do this. As such, a company must ration its capital among the best combination of projects with the highest total NPV.\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_230", "text": "\n\n\nThe primary factors that influence a company's capital-structure decision are:\n\n1. Business Risk \nExcluding debt, business risk is the basic risk of the company's operations. The greater the business risk, the lower the optimal debt ratio. \n\nAs an example, let's compare a utility company with a retail apparel company. A utility company generally has more stability in earnings. The company has les risk in its business given its stable revenue stream. However, a retail apparel company has the potential for a bit more variability in its earnings. Since the sales of a retail apparel company are driven primarily by trends in the fashion industry, the business risk of a retail apparel company is much higher. Thus, a retail apparel company would have a lower optimal debt ratio so that investors feel comfortable with the company's ability to meet its responsibilities with the capital structure in both good times and bad.\n\n2. Company's Tax Exposure \nDebt payments are tax deductible. As such, if a company's tax rate is high, using debt as a means of financing a project is attractive because the tax deductibility of the debt payments protects some income from taxes.\n\n3. Financial Flexibility\nThis is essentially the firm's ability to raise capital in bad times. It should come as no surprise that companies typically have no problem raising capital when sales are growing and earnings are strong. However, given a company's strong cash flow in the good times, raising capital is not as hard. Companies should make an effort to be prudent when raising capital in the good times, not stretching its capabilities too far. The lower a company's debt level, the more financial flexibility a company has. \n\nThe airline industry is a good example. In good times, the industry generates significant amounts of sales and thus cash flow. However, in bad times, that situation is reversed and the industry is in a position where it needs to borrow funds. If an airline becomes too debt ridden, it may have a decreased ability to raise debt capital during these bad times because investors may doubt the airline's ability to service its existing debt when it has new debt loaded on top.\n\n4. Management Style \nManagement styles range from aggressive to conservative. The more conservative a management's approach is, the less inclined it is to use debt to increase profits. An aggressive management may try to grow the firm quickly, using significant amounts of debt to ramp up the growth of the company's earnings per share (EPS).\n\n5. Growth Rate\nFirms that are in the growth stage of their cycle typically finance that growth through debt, borrowing money to grow faster. The conflict that arises with this method is that the revenues of growth firms are typically unstable and unproven. As such, a high debt load is usually not appropriate.\n\nMore stable and mature firms typically need less debt to finance growth as its revenues are stable and proven. These firms also generate cash flow, which can be used to finance projects when they arise.\n\n6. Market Conditions\nMarket conditions can have a significant impact on a company's capital-structure condition. Suppose a firm needs to borrow funds for a new plant. If the market is struggling, meaning investors are limiting companies' access to capital because of market concerns, the interest rate to borrow may be higher than a company would want to pay. In that situation, it may be prudent for a company to wait until market conditions return to a more normal state before the company tries to access funds for the plant.\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_231", "text": "\n\n\nTo further examine risk in the capital structure, two additional measures of risk found in capital budgeting:\n\n1. Business Risk\nA company's business risk is the risk of the firm's assets when no debt is used. Business risk is the risk inherent in the company's operations. As a result, there are many factors that can affect business risk: the more volatile these factors, the riskier the company. Some of those factors are as follows:\n\n\nSales risk - Sales risk is affected by demand for the company's product as well as the price per unit of the product. \n\nInput-cost risk - Input-cost risk is the volatility of the inputs into a company's product as well as the company's ability to change pricing if input costs change.\n\n\nAs an example, let's compare a utility company with a retail apparel company. A utility company generally has more stability in earnings. The company has les risk in its business given its stable revenue stream. However, a retail apparel company has the potential for a bit more variability in its earnings. Since the sales of a retail apparel company are driven primarily by trends in the fashion industry, the business risk of a retail apparel company is much higher. Thus, a retail apparel company would have a lower optimal debt ratio so that investors feel comfortable with the company's ability to meet its responsibilities with the capital structure in both good times and bad.\n\n2. Financial Risk\nA company's financial risk, however, takes into account a company's leverage. If a company has a high amount of leverage, the financial risk to stockholders is high - meaning if a company cannot cover its debt and enters bankruptcy, the risk to stockholders not getting satisfied monetarily is high.\n\nLet's use the troubled airline industry as an example. The average leverage for the industry is quite high (for some airlines, over 100%) given the issues the industry has faced over the past few years. Given the high leverage of the industry, there is extreme financial risk that one or more of the airlines will face an imminent bankruptcy.\n\nEffect of Changes in Sales or Earnings on EBIT\nDiffering amounts of debt financing cause changes in EPS and thus a company's stock price. The calculations for EBIT and EPS are as follows:\n\nFormula 11.16\n\n\n\n\nEBIT = sales - variable costs - fixed costs\nEPS = [(EBIT - interest)*(1-tax rate)] / shares outstanding\n\n\n\n\n\nThis LOS is best explained by the use of an example. \n\nExample:\nThe following is Newco's cost of debt at various capital structures.

The higher the fixed costs as a percentage of total costs, the higher the company's operating leverage. For companies with high operating leverage, a small change in company revenues will result in a larger change in operating income since most costs are fixed rather than variable.\n\nDegree of\u00a0Leverage\nThe degree of leverage within a company can be calculated based on various metrics. \n\nSome common metrics include: \n1. Degree of operating leverage\n2. Degree of financial leverage\n3.

With Project 1, the company's variable costs are $20 per unit, and its fixed costs total $2.4 million. With Project 2, the company's variable costs are $30 per unit, and its fixed costs total $2 million. Newco has the ability to see each unit at $50.

With a high degree of financial leverage come high interest payments. As a result, the bottom-line earnings per share is negatively affected by interest payments. As interest payments increase as a result of increased financial leverage, EPS is driven lower.\n\nAs mentioned previously, financial risk is the risk to the stockholders that is caused by an increase in debt and preferred equities in a company's capital structure. As a company increases debt and preferred equities, interest payments increase, reducing EPS. As a result, risk to stockholder return is increased. A company should keep its optimal capital structure in mind when making financing decisions to ensure any increases in debt and preferred equity increase the value of the company.\n\nDegree of Financial Leverage \nThis measures the percentage change in earnings per share over the percentage change in EBIT. This is known as \"degree of financial leverage\" (DFL). It is the measure of the sensitivity of EPS to changes in EBIT as a result of changes in debt. \n\nFormula 11.19\n\n\n\n\nDFL = percentage change in EPS or  EBIT\r\n\t\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0percentage change in EBIT\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 EBIT-interest\n\n\n\n\n\nA shortcut to keep in mind with DFL is that, if interest is 0, then the DLF will be equal to 1.\n\nExample: Degree of Financial Leverage\nWith Newco's current production, its sales are $7 million annually.

Wouldn't it thus make sense to maximize your debt load? The answer is no.\n\nWith an increased debt load the following occurs: \nInterest expense rises and cash flow needs to cover the interest expense also rise.\nDebt issuers become nervous that the company will not be able to cover its financial responsibilities with respect to the debt they are issuing.\n\nStockholders become also nervous. First, if interest increases, EPS decreases, and a lower stock price is valued. Additionally, if a company, in the worst case, goes bankrupt, the stockholders are the last to be paid retribution, if at all. \n\nIn our previous examples, EPS increased with every increase in our debt-to-equity ratio. However, in our prior discussions, an optimal capital structure is some combination of both equity and debt that maximizes not only earnings but also stock price. Recall that this is best implied by the capital structure that minimizes the company's WACC.\n\nExample:\nThe following is Newco's cost of debt at various capital structures. Newco has a tax rate of 40%. For this example, assume a risk-free rate of 4% and a market rate of 14%. For simplicity in determining stock prices, assume Newco pays out all of its earnings as dividends.\n\nFigure 11.15: Newco's cost of debt at various capital structures\n\n\n\nAt each level of debt, calculate Newco's WACC, assuming the CAPM model is used to calculate the cost of equity.\n\nAnswer:\nAt debt level 0%:\nCost of equity = 4% + 1.2(14% - 4%) = 16%\nCost of debt = 0% (1-40%) = 0%\nWACC = 0%(0%) + 100%(16%) = 16% \nStock price = $18.00/0.16 = $112.50 \n\nAt debt level 20%:\nCost of equity = 4% + 1.4(14% - 4%) = 18%\nCost of debt = 4%(1-40%) = 2.4%\nWACC = 20%(2.4%) + 80%(18%) = 14.88%\nStock price = $22.20/0.1488 = $149.19\n\nAt debt level 40%:\nCost of equity = 4% + 1.6(14% - 4%) = 20%\nCost of debt = 6% (1-40%) = 3.6%\nWACC = 40%(3.6%) + 60%(20%) = 13.44% \nStock price = $28.80/0.1344 = $214.29\n\nRecall that the minimum WACC is the level where stock price is maximized. As such, our optimal capital structure is 40% debt and 60% equity. While there is a tax benefit from debt, the risk to the equity can far outweigh the benefits - as indicated in the example.\n\nCompany vs. Stock Valuation\nThe value of a company's stock is but one part of the company's total value. The value of a company comprises the total value of the company's capital structure, including debtholders, preferred-equity holders and common-equity holders. Since both debtholders and preferred-equity holders have first rights to a company's value, common-equity holders have last rights to a company value, also known as a \"residual value\".\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_236", "text": "\n\nTax Effect on the Cost of Capital\r\nWith respect to taxes, it is important to keep in mind that interest payments on debt can be deducted as expenses and thus reduce overall taxes. However, a company cannot report dividends as an expense, so dividends have no effect on the taxes of a company. This is important for a company to keep in mind when determining and making changes to its capital structure.\n\nBankruptcy Effect on the Cost of Capital\r\nBankruptcy costs can also significantly affect a company's cost of capital. When a company invests in debt, the company is required to service the debt by making required interest payments. Interest payments alter a company's earnings as well as cash flow. For each company there is an optimal capital structure, including a percentage of debt and equity, a balance between the tax benefits of the debt and the equity. As a company continues to increase its debt over the amount stated by the optimal capital structure, the cost to finance the debt becomes higher as the debt is now riskier to the lender. The risk of bankruptcy increases with the increased debt load. Since the cost of debt becomes higher, the WACC is thus affected. With the addition of debt, the WACC will at first fall as the benefits are realized, but once the optimal capital structure is reached and then surpassed, the increased debt load will then cause the WACC to increase significantly.\r\n\u00a0\n        \n        \n            \n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_237", "text": "\n\nModigliani and Miller's Capital-Structure Irrelevance Proposition\nModigliani and Miller, two professors in the 1950s, studied capital-structure theory intensely.

For example, no matter how the firm borrows, there will be no tax benefit from interest payments and thus no changes/benefits to the WACC. Additionally, since there are no changes/benefits from increases in debt, the capital structure does not influence a company's stock price, and the capital structure is therefore irrelevant to a company's stock price.\n\nHowever, as we have stated, taxes and bankruptcy costs do significantly affect a company's stock price. In additional papers, Modigliani and Miller included both the effect of taxes and bankruptcy costs.\n\nThe MM Capital-Structure Irrelevance Proposition \nThe MM capital-structure irrelevance proposition assumes no taxes and no bankruptcy costs. As a result, MM states that the capital structure is irrelevant and has no impact on a company's stock price. \n\nThe Tradeoff Theory of Leverage\nThe tradeoff theory assumes that there are benefits to leverage within a capital structure up until the optimal capital structure is reached. The theory recognizes the tax benefit from interest payments. Studies suggest, however, that most companies have less leverage than this theory would suggest is optimal.\n\nIn comparing the two theories, the main difference between them is the potential benefit from debt in a capital structure. This benefit comes from tax benefit of the interest payments. Since the MM capital-structure irrelevance theory assumes no taxes, this benefit is not recognized, unlike the trade-off theory of leverage, where taxes and thus the tax benefit of interest payments are recognized.\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_238", "text": "\n\nOne of the key assumptions Modigliani and Miller make in their work is that market information is symmetric, meaning companies and investors have the same information with respect to the company's future projects/investments.

For example, suppose Newco decides to finance a new project with equity. Newco's additional equity would in fact dilute stockholder value. Since companies typically try to maximize stockholder value, would an equity offering be a bad signal? The answer is yes. \n\nThere would be some benefit from the project to the stockholders; however, the dilution from the offering would offset some of that benefit. If a company's prospects are good, management will finance new projects with other means, such as debt, to avoid giving any negative signals to the market.\n\n\n\n\n\nLook Out!\r\n\t\t\t\tFinancing a capital project with equity may be a signal to investors that a company's prospects are not good.\n\n\n\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_239", "text": "\n\nBy combining the degree of operating leverage with the degree of financial leverage we obtain the degree of total leverage (DTL).

This is known as the \"dividend-irrelevance theory\", indicating that there is no effect from dividends on a company's capital structure or stock price. \n\nMM's dividend-irrelevance theory says that investors can affect their return on a stock regardless of the stock's dividend. For example, suppose, from an investor's perspective, that a company's dividend is too big. That investor could then buy more stock with the dividend that is over the investor's expectations. Likewise, if, from an investor's perspective, a company's dividend is too small, an investor could sell some of the company's stock to replicate the cash flow he or she expected. As such, the dividend is irrelevant to investors, meaning investors care little about a company's dividend policy since they can simulate their own.\n\nBird-in-the-Hand Theory\nThe bird-in-the-hand theory, however, states that dividends are relevant. Remember that total return (k) is equal to dividend yield plus capital gains. Myron Gordon and John Lintner (Gordon/Litner) took this equation and assumed that k would decrease as a company's payout increased. As such, as a company increases its payout ratio, investors become concerned that the company's future capital gains will dissipate since the retained earnings that the company reinvests into the business will be less. \n\nGordon and Lintner argued that investors value dividends more than capital gains when making decisions related to stocks. The bird-in-the-hand may sound familiar as it is taken from an old saying: \"a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.\" In this theory \"the bird in the hand' is referring to dividends and \"the bush\" is referring to capital gains.\n\nTax-Preference Theory\nTaxes are important considerations for investors. Remember capital gains are taxed at a lower rate than dividends. As such, investors may prefer capital gains to dividends. This is known as the \"tax Preference theory\". \n\nAdditionally, capital gains are not paid until an investment is actually sold. Investors can control when capital gains are realized, but, they can't control dividend payments, over which the related company has control. \n\nCapital gains are also not realized in an estate situation. For example, suppose an investor purchased a stock in a company 50 years ago. The investor held the stock until his or her death, when it is passed on to an heir. That heir does not have to pay taxes on that stock's appreciation. \n\nThe Dividend-Irrelevance Theory and Company Valuation\nIn the determination of the value of a company, dividends are often used. However, MM's dividend-irrelevance theory indicates that there is no effect from dividends on a company's capital structure or stock price. \n\nMM's dividend-irrelevance theory says that investors can affect their return on a stock regardless of the stock's dividend. \n\nFor example, suppose, from an investor's perspective, that a company's dividend is too big.

If a company cuts its dividends, stockholders may become worried that the company is not generating enough earnings to satisfy its internal needs for cash as well as pay out its current dividend. A stock may decline in this instance. \n\nSuppose for example Newco decides to cuts its dividend to $0.25 per share from its initial value of $0.50 per share. How would this be perceived by investors?\n\nMost likely the cut in dividend by Newco would be perceived negatively by investors. Investors would assume that the company is beginning to go through some tough times and the company is trying to preserve cash. This would indicate that the business may be slowing or earnings are not growing at the rate it once had. \n\nTo learn more about dividends, read: The Importance of Dividends\n\nThe Clientele Effect.\nA company's change in dividend policy may impact in the company's stock price given changes in the \"clientele\" interested in owning the company's stock. Depending on their personal tax situation, some stockholders may prefer capital gains over dividends and vice versa as capital gains are taxed at a lower rate than dividends. The clientele effect is simply different stockholders' preference on receiving dividends compared to capital gains.\n\nFor example, a stockholder in a high tax bracket may favor stocks with low dividend payouts compared to a stockholder in a low tax-bracket who may favor stocks with higher dividend payouts.\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_242", "text": "\n\nThe residual-dividend model is a model that a company can utilize to set a target dividend payout ratio. \n\nThe residual-dividend model is based on three key pieces: \n1.

The company's optimal capital structure is 50% equity/50% debt. With $2 million in earnings, Newco reinvests the entire amount back into the company. In this case, Newco would have to borrow $2 million to maintain its optimal capital structure.\n\nIf Newco, however, needed to reinvest only half of the $2 million back into the company, Newco would then have $1 million in residual earnings to pay dividends. Given the reduced reinvestment, the company would thus have to borrow only $1 million to maintain its optimal capital structure.\n\nAdvantage of the Residual-Dividend Model\n\n\nWith capital-projects budgeting, the residual-dividend model is useful in setting longer-term dividend policy.\n\nDisadvantage of the Residual Dividend Model\n\n\nDividends may be unstable. Earnings from year to year can vary depending on business situations. As such, it is difficult to maintain with certainty stable earnings and thus a stable dividend.\n\n\nWhile the residual-dividend model is useful for longer-term planning, many firms do not use the model in calculating dividends each quarter.\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_243", "text": "\nDividend payouts follow a set procedure as follows:\n\nDeclaration date\nEx-dividend date\nHolder-of-record date\nPayment date\n\n1. Declaration Date\n\nDeclaration date is the announcement that the company's board of directors approved the payment of the dividend.\n\n2. Ex-Dividend Date\nThe ex-dividend date is the date on which investors are cut off from receiving a dividend. If for example, an investor purchases a stock on the ex-dividend date, that investor will not receive the dividend. This date is two business days before the holder-of-record date. \n\nThe ex-dividend date is important as, from this date and forward, new stockholders will not receive the dividend. As a result, the stock price of the company will be reflective of this. For example, on and after the ex-dividend date, a stock most likely trades at lower price, as the stock price is adjusted for the dividend that the new holder will not receive.\n\n3. Holder-of-Record Date\nThe holder-of-record (owner-of-record) date is the date on which the stockholders who are to receive the dividend are recognized.\n\n\n\n\n\nLook Out!\nRemember that stock transactions typically settle in three business days. \n\n\n\n\nUnderstanding the dates of the dividend payout process can be tricky. We clear up the confusion in the following article:\n\n4. Payment Date\nLast is the payment date, the date on which the actual dividend is paid out to the stockholders of record.\n\nExample of the process of\u00a0dividend payment\nSuppose Newco would like to pay a dividend to its shareholders. The company would proceed as follows:\n\n1.On Jan 28, the company declares it will pay its regular dividend of $0.30 per share to holders of record on Feb 27, with payment on Mar 17.\n2.The ex-dividend date for the dividend is Feb 23 (usually four days before of the holder-of-record date). On Feb 23 new buyers do not have a right to the dividend.\n3.At the close of business on Feb 27, all holders of Newco's stock are recorded, and those holders will receive the dividend.\n4.On Mar 17, the payment date, Newco mails the dividend checks to the holders of record.\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_244", "text": "\n\nLike cash dividends, stock dividends and stock splits also have effects on a company's stock price. Stock splits occur when a company perceives that its stock price may be too high. Companies tend to want to keep their stock price within an optimal trading range. \nWhile stock prices will most likely rise after a split or dividend (remember price increases are caused by positive signals a company generates with respect to future earnings), if positive news does not follow, the company's stock price will generally fall back to its original level. \nThere is an argument that stock splits and stock dividends are unnecessary and do little more than create more stocks.\nStock Split\nIn a stock split, a company will divide each share of its existing stock into multiple shares to bring down the company's stock price. \nExample:\nSuppose Newco's stock reaches $60 per share. The company's management believes this is too high and that some investors may not invest in the company as a result of the initial price required to buy the stock. As such, the company decides to split the stock to make the entry point of the shares more accessible. \nFor simplicity, suppose Newco initiates a 2-for-1 stock split. For each share they own, all holders of Newco stock therefore receive two Newco shares priced at $30, and the company's shares outstanding double. Keep in mind that the company's overall equity value remains the same. Say there are 1 million shares outstanding and the company's initial equity value is $60 million ($60 per share x 1 million shares outstanding). The equity value after the split is still $60 million ($30 per share x 2 million shares outstanding).\nTo learn more about stock splits, read: Understanding Stock Splits\nStock Dividends\nStock dividends are similar to cash dividends; however, instead of cash, a company pays out stock. As a result, a company's shares outstanding will increase, and the company's stock price will decrease. For example, suppose Newco decides to issue a 10% stock dividend. Each current stockholder will thus have 10% more shares after the dividend is issued. \nStock Repurchase \nA stock repurchase occurs when a company asks stockholders to tender their shares for repurchase by the company. This is an alternate way for a company to increase value for stockholders. First, a repurchase can be used to restructure the company's capital structure without increasing the company's debt load. Additionally, rather than a company changing its dividend policy, it can offer value to its stockholders through stock repurchases, keeping in mind that capital gains taxes are lower than taxes on dividends.\nAdvantages of a Stock Repurchase\nMany companies initiate a share repurchase at a price level that management deems a good entry point. This point tends to be when the stock is estimated to be undervalued. If a company knows its business and relative stock price well, would it purchase its stock price at a high level? The answer is no, leading investors to believe the management perceives its stock price to be at a low level.\nUnlike a cash dividend, a stock repurchase gives the decision to the investor. A stockholder can choose to tender his shares for repurchase, accept the payment and pay the taxes. With a cash dividend, a stockholder has no choice but to accept the dividend and pay the taxes.\nAt times, there may be a block of shares from one or more large shareholders that could come into the market, but the timing may be unknown. This problem may actually keep potential stockholders away since they may be worried about a flood of shares coming onto the market and lessening the stock's value. A stock repurchase can be quite useful in this situation.\n\u00a0\nDisadvantage of a Stock Repurchase\nFrom the perspective of an investor, a cash dividend is dependable, usually quarterly. A stock repurchase, however, is not. For some investors, the dependability of the dividend may be more important. As such, investors may invest more heavily in a stock with a dependable dividend than in a stock with less dependable repurchases.\nA company may be in a position where it ends up paying too much for the stock it repurchases. For example, say a company repurchases its shares for $30 per share on June 1. On June 10, a major hurricane damages the company's primary operations. The company's stock therefore drops down to $20. Thus, the $10-per-share difference is a lost opportunity to the company.\nOverall, stockholders who offer their shares for repurchase may be at a disadvantage if they are not fully aware of all the details. As such, an investor may file a lawsuit with the company, which is seen as a risk.\n\t\u00a0\nPrice Effect of a Stock Repurchase\nA stock repurchase typically has the effect of increasing the price of a stock.\nExample: Newco has 20,000 shares outstanding and a net income of $100,000. The current stock price is $40. What effect does a 5% stock repurchase have on the price per share of Newco's stock?\nAnswer: To keep it simple, price-per-earnings ratio (P/E) is the valuation metric used to value Newco's price per share.\nNewco's current EPS = $100,000/20,000 = $5 per share \nP/E ratio = $40/$5 = 8x\nWith a 5% stock repurchase, the following occurs:\nNewco's shares outstanding are reduced to 19,000 shares (20,000 x (1-.05))\nNewco's EPS = $100,000/19,000 = $5.26\nGiven that Newco's shares trade on 8 times earnings, Newco's new share price would be $42, an increase from the $40 per share before the repurchase.\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_245", "text": "\nThe following section focuses on how the markets themselves function. Understanding how the markets function is key in determining how securities themselves function.\n\r\nIt is unlikely that your CFA Level 1 exam will test you directly on the topics presented, as the material itself is quite simplistic. However, you will be asked several comprehensive questions on this material.\n\nCHARACTERISTICS\nThe characteristics of a well-functioning securities market are:\n\n\nEfficient - Internal - Markets must be efficient internally.\n\nEfficient - External - Markets react quickly to new news; existing prices reflect all available information.\n\nLiquidity - Markets are liquid and as such, assets can be bought or sold easily. There are numerous buyers and sellers giving depth to the market.\n\nContinuity - In the context of liquidity, prices do not change substantially from one transaction to another unless significant new news arises.\n\nMarketability - In the context of liquidity, marketability is the ability to sell an asset quickly.\n\nTimely and accurate information - New information is brought to the market in a timely and accurate way. \n\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_246", "text": "\n\n\nHow Do Investment Banks Issue Bonds?\nIn the new issuance of bonds, an investment bank has options with respect to how to place the bonds in the market. These options are as follows:\n\n1. Competitive Bids \nCompetitive bids are the process in which the bond issuer solicits bids from the underwriting of various investment banks. This is typically used in dealing with municipal bonds.\n\n2. Negotiated Sales\nA negotiated sale is the process whereby a bond issuer negotiates with the investment bank with respect to the pricing of underwriting services. \n\n3. Private Placements\nA private placement is the process whereby an investment bank \"places\" the new bond issue with a small number of buyers, typically large institutions. Private placements are not registered with the SEC for public sale.\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_247", "text": "\n\n\nThe Primary Market \nThe primary market refers to the market where new issues (stocks and bonds not sold before) are sold. Investment bankers, acting as underwriters, bring new issues to the market through the primary market. This can be done as either an Initial Public Offering (IPO), when the stock has not previously traded, or as a seasoned offering once the stock has traded but new shares are being added to the market. \n\nThe Secondary Market\nA secondary market is the market in which assets are traded after they have been sold through the primary market. In this market, investors trade directly with each other through an exchange. \n\nIf the secondary market for a stock follows the characteristics we discussed previously, such as liquidity and marketability, and the issuer would like to issue more shares through a seasoned offering, the issuer would have a much easier time selling the new shares in the primary market.\n\nFor more on the markets where securities are traded, check out the article, Markets Demystified\n\nSecondary markets for U.S. government/municipal bonds are traded primarily through banks, including investment banks. Treasuries, however, are traded through treasury dealers. Secondary markets for corporate bonds are primarily through the OTC market. In addition to the OTC market, secondary trading for corporate bonds also takes place on the New York Stock Exchange and the American Stock Exchange.\n\r\n\t\u00a0\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_248", "text": "\n\n\nCall vs. Continuous Markets\nThere are two typical structures of a securities exchange. They are:\n\n\nCall Markets \nA call market is a market where a stock can only trade at a specific time. Bids for the stock are collected and then traded at a specific time and at one price. Because this market trades only at specific times and at one negotiated price, it is typically only used for smaller markets.\n\n\n\nContinuous Markets\nA continuous market can occur at any time as long as the market is open. Buyers and sellers are matched up on a continuous basis and the price is determined through an auction or through bid-ask quotes.\n\nStructural Differences Among the Different Markets\nWhile markets and exchanges facilitate the buying and selling of securities, there are some structural differences among them.\n\n\nNational Stock Exchanges\nThese exchanges trade numerous issues of diverse shares to a wide number of investors. A national stock exchange operates as an auction market where buyers and sellers are driven by price. The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and the American Stock Exchange (AMEX) are examples of national stock exchanges in the U.S. The London Stock Exchange (LSE) is an example of a national stock exchange outside of the U.S. A national stock exchange typically has stringent qualifications a stock must meet in order to be listed.\n\n\n\nRegional Exchanges\nA regional exchange is similar to the national stock exchanges except regional exchanges serve smaller markets and typically trade smaller issues. A company that cannot list its shares on a national stock exchange because it does not meet the requirements may choose to list its share on a regional exchange. The Boston exchange is an example of a regional exchange in the U.S.\n\n\n\nOver-the-Counter Markets (OTC)\nAn OTC market is a less formal exchange. Both listed stocks and unlisted stocks can trade in the OTC market. The OTC market operates as an order-driven market where buyers and sellers submit bids and a dealer buys or sells the stock from his own inventory. Unlike a national exchange where a broker matches buyers and sellers, an OTC market comprises any securities for which there is a market. As a result, the OTC market is also referred to as a negotiated market. In the U.S., the Nasdaq system is used as the quotation system for the OTC market.\n\nIt is important to understand the relationship between exchanges and companies and the ways in which the requirements of different exchanges provide protection to investors. For more on the exchanges, review the article: Getting to Know Stock Exchanges\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_249", "text": "\n\n\nThe main characteristics of exchange markets can be classified into:\n\n1. Exchange Membership\nIn the U.S., the listed securities exchanges classify memberships as:\n\n\nSpecialists: Specialists are the market makers for stocks, controlling the limit book and posting bid and ask prices.\n\nCommission Brokers: Commission brokers are employees of a firm that is a member of the exchange. The commission broker buys and sells shares for the clients of its firm. \n\nFloor Brokers: Floor brokers function much like commission brokers buying and selling shares. Unlike commission brokers who are employees of member firms however, floor brokers are independent and aid commission brokers when they become too busy. \n\nRegistered Traders: Registered traders are members that buy and sell for their own account. They help to provide liquidity. Because they are independent, however, the exchange places limits on how they trade.\n\n\r\n\t\u00a0\n\n2. Types of Orders\nAn order on an exchange can be classified as follows:\n\n\nMarket Order: A market order is a basic order to buy or sell a security at the best available price. For example, a client places an order to buy 100 shares of Newco; the client expects/wants the best available price for buying those shares.\n\nLimit Order: A limit order places a specific price at which a transaction is executed. These orders typically have a set time horizon in which the limit order can be executed. For example, Newco's stock is trading at $50. A client places a buy limit order to purchase shares at $45. The transaction will thus be executed when the shares reach $45, if they do. Otherwise, the order will expire in the allotted time.\n\nShort Sale Order: A short sale order is an order to sell shares that a client does not own. As a result, the trader must borrow the stock, sell it, and then buy the stock again to replace the shares he borrowed. For example, a client wants to sell 100 shares of Newco short at $45. The trader must borrow 100 shares, sell the 100 shares and then purchases the shares to replace the ones he borrowed. A client may do this if he believes shares of the respective company will decline below the price at which the shares were sold short. \n\nStop Loss Orders: Stop loss orders are placed in order to prevent losses on shares below a specified share price. For example, an investor bought shares of Newco at $50. The shares appreciated to $100. The investor is interested in protecting some profit on the shares of Newco in case the price starts declining. This investor may place a stop loss order on the shares of Newco at $80. If Newco's shares decline to $80, the stop loss order would be executed, protecting some of the investor's profit. Whether you use this strategy for your own or for a client's portfolio, stop loss orders are essentially a simple but powerful tool to help implement a stock-investment strategy.

Market Makers\nMarket makers facilitate the trading in a stock, buying and selling stock from their own accounts in order to maintain orderly trading and provide liquidity in a stock if it is needed. Additionally, the market maker manages the limit order book where both limit and stop orders are recorded. In the U.S. exchanges, the market maker is known as a specialist. \r\n\t\u00a0\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_250", "text": "\n\n\nThe Process of Shorting Stock\nA short sale order, or a stock sold short, is an order to sell shares that a client does not own. As a result, the trader must borrow the stock from an existing client, sell the shares of the security and then buy the stock again to replace the shares he borrowed. In doing this, there are three rules that must be followed:\n\n\nA short sale order can only be done in what is known as an \"up market\" where the market is appreciating, not declining. This is known as the uptick rule.\n\nIf a dividend is paid on the shares, the investor selling the shares short pays the dividend to the investor he borrowed the shares from.\n\nAn investor cannot borrow shares to sell short without providing some sort of collateral.\n\nAn investor may want to sell a stock short if the investor believes that stock is going to decline. For example, a client wants to sell 100 shares of Newco short at $45. The trader sells 100 shares he borrowed from another investor at $45. The amount from the sale goes to the investor selling the shares short. The investor is hoping the shares go below the $45. If, for example, the shares decline to $35, the investor already sold the shares at $45. The investor can thus repurchase the shares at $35 and replace the shares he borrowed. Excluding transaction costs, the investor had made $10 per share on the transaction.\n\nHave you ever correctly predicted a stock's decline or wondered how to be profitable in a bear market?

A brokerage firm lends money to an investor to buy stocks. The brokerage firm will charge interest on the money it lends. The Federal Reserve Board has placed limits on margin buying. Currently the initial margin requirement (the required equity position to enter into a margin transaction) is 50%, meaning the investor must provide at least 50% of the amount of funds needed to enter into the trade. The brokerage firm will provide the remainder of the funds. The brokerage firm will then hold the securities that are bought as collateral. \nIf the stock goes up after it is purchased, the investor's profit will be magnified given the stocks purchased on margin. However, if the stock goes down, the losses are then magnified.\nExample: Determine the return on a margin tradeAssume that an investor purchased 500 shares of Newco's stock. The shares were trading at $50 when the transaction was executed. Assume the investor was able to sell the shares for $100. To determine the effect of the leverage with purchasing the shares on margin, compute the return on the transaction if (1) no margin was used and (2) 70% initial margin requirement was used. Assume no transaction costs.\nAnswer:\n1) No margin was usedIf no margin was used, the initial cash outlay for the shares was $25,000 (500 shares at $50). The investor then sold the shares for $50,000 (500 shares at $100).\nThe return on the trade was thus ($50,000/$25,000) - 1 = 100%.\n2) 70% initial margin requirementGiven the initial margin requirement of 70%, the investor would need an initial cash outlay of $17,500 ($25,000\u00a0x 70%). The investor borrowed $7,500 ($25,000 x 30%) from the brokerage firm to complete the transaction.\nThe investor was then able to sell the shares for $50,000 (500 shares at $100). The investor then repays the amount borrowed of $7,500 and the remaining position would be equal to $42,500 ($50,000 - $7,500). \nThe return on the trade was thus ($42,500/$17,500) - 1 = 142.9%.\nAs shown in the examples above, the investor was able to magnify his returns by buying stock on margin. \nWhat is Maintenance Margin?A maintenance margin is the required amount of securities an investor must hold in his account if he either purchases shares on margin, or if he sells shares short. If an investor's margin balance falls below the set maintenance margin, the investor would then need to contribute additional funds to the account or liquidate stocks in the account to bring the account back to the initial margin requirement. This request is known as a margin call.\nAs discussed previously, the Federal Reserve Board sets the initial margin requirement (currently at 50%). The Federal Reserve Board also sets the maintenance margin. The maintenance margin, the amount of equity an investor needs to hold in his account if he buys stock on margin or sells shares short, is 25%. Keep in mind, however, that this 25% level is the minimum level set, brokerage firms can increase, but not decrease this level as they desire.\nExample: Determining when a margin call would occur.Assume that an investor had purchased 500 shares of Newco's stock. The shares were trading at $50 when the transaction was executed. The initial margin requirement on the account was 70% and the maintenance margin is 30%. Assume no transaction costs. Determine the price at which the investor will receive a margin call.\nAnswer:Calculate the price as follows:\n$50 (1- 0.70) = $21.43 \u00a0 1 - 0.30\nA margin call would be received when the price of Newco's stock fell below $21.43 per share. At that time, the investor would either need to deposit additional funds or liquidate shares to satisfy the initial margin requirement.\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_252", "text": "\n\nAs trading has grown and globalization of the capital markets has occurred over the years, institutionalization of securities markets transpired.

Given the institutionalization of securities markets, commissions were structured by the SEC and work to limit unfair practices with respect to how firms charge commissions for trading.\n\n2. Block Trades\nBlock trades are large trades that are primarily done through institutions. Given the growth of the financial markets, block trades have increased in frequency. As a result, block trading houses were developed to handle these trades in an organized and efficient manner so as not to disrupt the securities market and cause large-scale volatility.\n\n3. National Market System\nThe National Market System (NMS) has been proposed; it would provide even greater efficiency with lower transaction costs. In proposals, the NMS would contain a centralized reporting system, a centralized quotation system, centralized limit order book and increased competition among all market makers. \n\n4. Stock Price Volatility Impact\nOne theory of the institutionalization of securities markets is that volatility is increased given the increased institutional trading, typically done in block trades. The counter-argument to the theory is that institutional trading will decrease volatility because it will make the markets more liquid.

Price Weighted Series\nA price weighted series is the average of the stocks' prices in the series. It is calculated by adding together each stock price and dividing the total by the number of stocks in the series.\n\nFormula 12.1\n\n\n\n\nPrice weighted series = Sum of stock prices\r\n\t\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0# of stocks\n\n\n\n\nThe main problem that occurs with the price weighted series is the effect a price change in a high-priced stock will have on the series, as well as the lack of effect a low-priced stock will have on the series. \n\nTwo well-known examples of a price weighted series are the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nikkei Dow Jones Stock Average.\r\n\u00a0\r\n\n2. Market Weighted Series\n\nA market weighted series is the market value (stock price multiplied by shares outstanding) of each company in the series divided by a sum calculated in the base period. This amount is then multiplied by the base value. \n\nFormula 12.2\n\n\n\n\n\nMarket Weighted Series = Sum of current market values\u00a0x beginning value\r\n\t\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sum of base market values\n\n\n\n\nSimilar to the price weighted series, the major problem with the market weighted series is the effect a market value change in a large market cap stock will have on the series, as well as the lack of effect a small market cap stock will have on the series. \n\nWell-known examples of a market-weighted series are the S&P 500 Index Composite, the New York Stock Exchange Index and the Financial Times Actuaries Share Indexes.\n\n3. Unweighted Series\nAn unweighted series is based on the average price movement of the stock prices in the index. In this series, all stocks, no matter what the price, have the same effect on the series. To calculate the unweighted series, take an arithmetic average or a geometric mean of the relative returns.\n\nFormula 12.3\n\n\n\n\nUnweighted price series = (X1 + X2 + ... + Xn)1/n\n\n\n\n\nThe Value Line Composite Average and the Financial Times Ordinary Share Index are examples of unweighted series.\n\n\nPredominant Weighting Schemes Bias: Source and Direction\n\n\nPrice Weighted Series Bias: Recall that the denominator of the price weighted series is the number of stocks with the stock price as the numerator. The problem occurs when a stock dividend or stock repurchase takes place. The numerator is adjusted to reflect the new stock price and the denominator needs to be adjusted to reflect the stock change. These changes tend to put a downward bias on the series as larger firms split their stock.\n\n\n\nMarket Weighted Series Bias: As mentioned previously, large market cap stocks have a greater effect on the market weighted series relative to small market cap stocks. As such, swings in the value of the larger cap stocks will have a greater effect on the overall series.\n\n\n\nUnweighted series Bias: The calculation of an unweighted series can be done through an arithmetic or geometric average. But if a geometric average is used, there will be a downward bias relative to pricing as compared to the series calculation using the arithmetic average.\n\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_254", "text": "\n\nThe methods of calculating the various weighting schemes is best explained by examples:\n\nExample: Price Weighted Series\nGiven the following series data, calculate the price weighted return over a one-year period.\nStock Price Info for Series 1\nAnswer:\nTo calculate the return over a one-year period, first calculate the price weighted series value at each date.\n\u00a0\nThe one-year return for the price weighted series would thus be (45/40) - 1 = 12.5%\n\nExample: Market Weighted Series\nGiven the following series data, calculate the market weighted return over the one-year period.\n\nStock Price Info for Series 2\nAnswer:\nExample: Unweighted Series\nGiven the following series data, calculate the unweighted return over a one-year period.\n\nStock Price Info for Series 3\nAnswer:\nGeometric Average = (1.05 x 1.25 x 1.00 x 1.30)1/4 = 1.143\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_255", "text": "\n\n\nAn index measures the movement of a select group of stocks, based on size, industry, etc. It is also a gauge to measure the relative return on a specific stock within that index.\n\nDomestic Stock Indexes\nA domestic stock index is made up of domestic stock securities and can be based on various components such as market cap, whether it is a value or growth index and many other components.

To be included in the index, a company must have a minimum market cap of $4 billion, be financially viable and have a public float of at least 50%.\n\nGlobal Stock Indexes\nA global stock index is similar to a domestic stock index except that it is made up of both domestic and international equity securities. An example of a global index is the S&P Global 1200. The index comprises securities in 29 countries. The key component for a security to be included in a global stock index is that it is tradable. For a global investor, this is a nice gauge to measure relative return. \n\nBond Indexes\nBond indexes are much trickier to construct than stock indexes. Given that there are typically many bonds issued for each company, there are many times more bond issues than stock issues to choose from. A bond index thus takes a sampling to create an index. An example of a bond index is the Lehman Brothers Aggregate Bond Index, which made up of 5,545 bonds across all segments of fixed income, including corporate, treasury and mortgage-backed segments.\n\nComposite Stock-Bond Indexes\nComposite stock-bond indexes are good proxies to measure a diversified stock/bond portfolio. These composites contain both stock and bond securities. The Merrill Lynch -Wilshire U.S. Capital Markets Index is an example of a composite stock-bond index. \n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_256", "text": "\n\n\nWhat is An Efficient Capital Market?\nAn efficient capital market is a market that reflects all available news and information. An efficient market is also quick to absorb new information and adjust stock prices relative to that information. This is known as an informationally efficient market. Generally, efficient markets are expected to reflect all available information. If that is not the case, investors with the information may benefit leading to abnormal returns. \n\nThe following are the main assumptions for a market to be efficient:\n\n\nA large number of investors analyze and value securities for profit.\n\nNew information comes to the market independent from other news and in a random fashion.\n\nStock prices adjust quickly to new information.\n\nStock prices should reflect all available information.\n\r\nTo learn more about the Efficient Market Hypothesis, please take a look the following article: Working Through the Efficient Market Hypothesis\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_257", "text": "\n\n\nThe Three Basic Forms of the EMH\nThe efficient market hypothesis assumes that markets are efficient. However, the efficient market hypothesis (EMH) can be categorized into three basic levels:\n\n1. Weak-Form EMH\nThe weak-form EMH implies that the market is efficient, reflecting all market information. This hypothesis assumes that the rates of return on the market should be independent; past rates of return have no effect on future rates. Given this assumption, rules such as the ones traders use to buy or sell a stock, are invalid. \n\n2. Semi-Strong EMH \nThe semi-strong form EMH implies that the market is efficient, reflecting all publicly available information. This hypothesis assumes that stocks adjust quickly to absorb new information. The semi-strong form EMH also incorporates the weak-form hypothesis. Given the assumption that stock prices reflect all new available information and investors purchase stocks after this information is released, an investor cannot benefit over and above the market by trading on new information.\n\n3. Strong-Form EMH \nThe strong-form EMH implies that the market is efficient: it reflects all information both public and private, building and incorporating the weak-form EMH and the semi-strong form EMH. Given the assumption that stock prices reflect all information (public as well as private) no investor would be able to profit above the average investor even if he was given new information.\n\n\nWeak Form Tests\nThe tests of the weak form of the EMH can be categorized as:\n\n\nStatistical Tests for Independence - In our discussion on the weak-form EMH, we stated that the weak-form EMH assumes that the rates of return on the market are independent. Given that assumption, the tests used to examine the weak form of the EMH test for the independence assumption. Examples of these tests are the autocorrelation tests (returns are not significantly correlated over time) and runs tests (stock price changes are independent over time).\n\nTrading Tests - Another point we discussed regarding the weak-form EMH is that past returns are not indicative of future results, therefore, the rules that traders follow are invalid. An example of a trading test would be the filter rule, which shows that after transaction costs, an investor cannot earn an abnormal return. \n\n\n\nSemi-strong Form Tests\nGiven that the semi-strong form implies that the market is reflective of all publicly available information, the tests of the semi-strong form of the EMH are as follows:\n\n\nEvent Tests - The semi-strong form assumes that the market is reflective of all publicly available information. An event test analyzes the security both before and after an event, such as earnings. The idea behind the event test is that an investor will not be able to reap an above average return by trading on an event.\n\nRegression/Time Series Tests - Remember that a time series forecasts returns based historical data. As a result, an investor should not be able to achieve an abnormal return using this method.\n\n\n\nStrong-Form Tests\nGiven that the strong-form implies that the market is reflective of all information, both public and private, the tests for the strong-form center around groups of investors with excess information. These investors are as follows:\n\n\nInsiders - Insiders to a company, such as senior managers, have access to inside information. SEC regulations forbid insiders for using this information to achieve abnormal returns.\n\nExchange Specialists - An exchange specialist recalls runs on the orders for a specific equity. It has been found however, that exchange specialists can achieve above average returns with this specific order information.\n\nAnalysts - The equity analyst has been an interesting test. It analyzes whether an analyst's opinion can help an investor achieve above average returns. Analysts do typically cause movements in the equities they focus on.\n\nInstitutional money managers - Institutional money managers, working for mutual funds, pensions and other types of institutional accounts, have been found to have typically not perform above the overall market benchmark on a consistent basis.\n\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_258", "text": "\n\n\n1. Earnings Reports \nIt has been shown that an investor can profit from investing immediately when a company reports because it takes time for the market to absorb the new information. This goes against the EMH.\n\n2. January Anomaly \nThe January effect goes against the EMH. Essentially the January effect indicates that as a result of tax-related moves, investors have been shown to profit by buying stocks in December as they are being sold for losses and then selling them again in January.\n\n3. Price-Earnings Ratio \nInvesting using the P/E ratio valuation metric has been an anomaly against the EMH. It has been shown that investors can profit by investing in companies with a low P/E ratio.\n\n4. Price-Earnings/Growth (PEG) Ratio \nInvesting using the PEG valuation metric has been anomaly against the EMH. It has been shown similar to the P/E ratio that investors profit by investing in companies with low PEG ratios.\n\n5. Size Effect \nGoing against EMH, it has been shown that smaller companies, on a risk-adjusted basis, have greater returns their larger peers.\n\n6. Neglected Firms \nNeglected firms are firms that Wall Street analysts deem too small to cover. As a result, these firms tend to generate larger levels of return, negating the EMH.\n\n\nOverall Conclusions About Each Form of the EMH\n\n\nWeak-Form EMH\nThe weak-form EMH is supported by the tests and analysis done. Essentially, the weak-form holds that abnormal returns are not achievable with the use of past-historical data as a means to generate returns.\n\n\n\nSemi-strong Form EMH\nThe semi-strong form EMH, at times, is both supported and not supported by the tests and analysis done. There has been some evidence that securities are not reflective of the semi-strong form EMH.\n\n\n\nStrong Form EMH\nIt appears from the tests and analysis performed, that the strong-form EMH does hold. While insiders and specialists do have access to private information, SEC regulations forbid this information to be used.\n\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_259", "text": "\n\n\nEMH and Technical Analysis\nTechnical analysis bases decisions on past results. EMH, however, believes past results cannot be used to outperform the market. As a result, EMH negates the use of technical analysis as a means to generate investment returns.\n\nWith respect to fundamental analysis, the EMH also states that all publicly available information is reflected in security prices and as such, abnormal returns are not achievable through the use of this information. This negates the use of fundamental analysis as a means to generate investment returns.\n\nEMH and the Portfolio Management Process\nAs we have discussed, the portfolio management process begins with an investment policy statement, including an investor's objectives and constraints. Given EMH, the portfolio management process should thus, not focus on achieving above-average returns for the investor. The portfolio management process should focus purely on risks given that above average returns are not achievable.\n\nA portfolio manager's goal is to outperform a specific benchmark with specific investment ideas. The EMH implies that this goal is unachievable. A portfolio manager should not be able to achieve above average returns.\n\nWhy Invest in Index Funds?\nGiven the discussion on the EMH, the overall assumption is that no investor is able to generate an abnormal return in the market. If that is the case, an investor can expect to make a return equal to the market return. An investor should thus focus on the minimizing his costs to invest. To achieve a market rate of return, diversification in a numerous amounts of stocks is required, which may not be an option for a smaller investor. As such, an index fund would be the most appropriate investment vehicle, allowing the investor to achieve the market rate of return in a cost effective manner. \n\n\nConclusion\nWithin this section we have discussed the organization and function of securities markets, the composition and characteristics of the various weighting schemes, and the various implications of the efficient market hypothesis.\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_260", "text": "\n\nThe material presented in this section will comprise over 10% of your upcoming CFA Level 1 exam. This translates to approximately 25 questions. Expect the bulk of the questions to be on analyzing a company.\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_261", "text": "\n\nThe Top-Down Approach\nThe top-down approach is a valuation approach that begins with first analyzing the overall economy and then continuing to drill down to the specific analysis. The idea behind the top-down approach when valuing securities is to start from a high level analysis: the general economic conditions. The next step would then be to analyze a specific industry within the economy. Lastly, an investor would compare and analyze specific securities to invest in.\n\nThe top-down approach allows an investor to make an informed investment decision based on a keen understanding of the economy and industry and how that relates the stock, versus comparing the stocks fundamentally against their peers without thinking about the overall movement in the market. \n\nThe top-down approach can be particularly useful when analyzing the valuation of world stocks. Given the starting point of understanding the world economies, an investor is able choose an appropriate stock based on areas of the world that may be doing better. \n\nThe Different Forms of Investment Returns\nWhen considering an investment there are various forms of investment returns that could be used, depending on the type of asset being evaluated. For example, when valuing a Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT), a price to cash flow metric may be more important as a measure of return. For a stock, dividend income or earnings may be an appropriate form of return to analyze. For bonds, an investor may consider cash flow.\n\nThe important thing to keep in mind at this point is maintaining consistency with the form of investment return used. We'll discuss the various forms of investment returns in detail within the remainder of this book.\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_262", "text": "\nValue of a Preferred Stock\nUnlike common equity, preferred stocks pay a fixed dividend. As such, the value of a preferred stock can be calculated using the dividend discount model. The value of the preferred stock is essentially the present value of the dividend in perpetuity, where k is the required return.\nFormula 13.1\n\u00a0\nValue of preferred stock\nExample: Calculating the value of a preferred stock\nAssume that Newco's preferred stock pays out to an investor an annual dividend of $8 per share. Given a rate of return of 10%, what is the value of Newco's preferred stock?\nAnswer:\nValue of Newco's preferred stock = ($8/0.10) = $80\u00a0\nValue of a Common Stock\nMuch like a preferred stock, holders of common stock can also receive dividends. However, dividends on common stock are not guaranteed, nor are they a fixed amount from year-to-year. As such, we can value common stock using dividends over various time horizons.\n1. One-year Holding period\nConsider a one-year holding period, in this time frame, an investor will receive a dividend and the price of the common stock at the end of the one year, both discounted back by the rate of return on the common equity.\nKeeping this in mind, we can calculate the value of the common stock as follows:\nFormula 13.2\n\nExample: Calculate the value of a stock with a 1-year holding period\nNewco expects to pay its shareholders common equity, $0.25 per share this year. The investor anticipates Newco's stock will close the year at $30 per share. Given a rate of return of 10%, what is the value of Newco's common stock?\nAnswer:\n2. Multiple-year holding period\nGiven investors can hold a common stock for over a year, it is useful to value a stock over the investor's expected holding period. In this case, the DDM model can be used.\nFormula 13.3\n\u00a0\nValue of common equity\nExample: Calculate the value of a stock with a multiple-year holdingperiod\nAn investor plans to hold Newco's stock for 2 years. Newco expects to pay its shareholders common equity, $0.25 per share over the next two years. The investor anticipates Newco's stock will close the end of that time period at $40 per share. Given a rate of return of 10%, what is the value of Newco's common stock at the end of the two-year time period?\nAnswer:\n3. Infinite Period DDM\nTo value a common stock using the infinite period DDM, the calculation is simplified much like it is when valuing a preferred stock with infinite dividends.\nFormula 13.4\n\n\t\t\tWhere k = rate of return, g = growth rate \nExample: Calculate the value of common stock with infinite dividends\nNewco paid a $0.25 annual dividend in 2004 and expects to pay $0.265 in 2005. Assuming a 6% growth rate and a required rate of return of 10%, calculate the value of Newco's stock.\nAnswer:\nValuing the Common Stock of Companies with Supernormal Growth\nWhen valuing a common stock of a company which is experiencing significant growth, we take a similar approach to valuing the common stock with a multi-year holding period. The difference in the approaches is related to the dividend. A multi-year holding period approach assumes a stable dividend, whereas the dividend changes given the supernormal growth in this approach.\nFormula 13.5\n\nExample: Calculate the value of common stock with temporary supernormal growth\nAn investor plans to hold Newco's stock for 3 years. In that time period, Newco plans to grow at a rate of 6% in the first two years and 3% thereafter. Newco's last dividend was $0.25. Given a rate of return of 10%, what is the value of Newco's common stock at the end of the three-year time period?\nAnswer:\nTo begin, the dividend in each time period must be calculated [D = D0(1+g)]\nD1 = (0.25)(1.06) = 0.265\nD2 = (0.265)(1.06) = 0.281\nD3 = (0.281)(1.03) = 0.289\nSince we expect the dividend to grow indefinitely in year 3 and on, the present value of the stock price in year 3 is calculated as follows:\n\nThe value of Newco's common stock is as follows:\n\nUsing the DDM to Develop an Earnings Multiplier Model\nDeveloping the earnings multiplier using the DDM begins with the basic determinant of price. Recall, to determine the price of a stock using the DDM, the infinite dividend is divided by the required return minus the growth rate as follows:\n\u00a0\n\nTo determine the price to earnings multiple, the price of the stock is simply divided by the earnings per share of the stock as follows:\nFormula 13.6\n\nExample: Determining a company's price-to-earnings ratio using the DDM\nWith Newco's $0.25 dividend payout, an EPS of $1.00, calculate the stock's P/E ratio assuming 10% required return and 5% growth.\nAnswer:\n\nLook Out!\nIn terms of changes in the dividend, the required return and the growth rate affect the DDM. Changes in these variables will also affect the stock's P/E ratio.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_263", "text": "\n\nThe Components of An Investors' Required Rate of Return\n\n\nReal risk-free rate - This rate assumes no inflation or risk is prevalent, but that it is simply generated by the supply and demand of the markets.\n\nExpected rate of inflation - This rate anticipates the potential inflation that is going to occur in the market.\n\nRisk premium - The premium is reflective of the risks inherent in the stock, as well as the market.

It is important to understand an industry's growth prospects to determine an appropriate growth rate.\n\nCompetition\nCompetition in a global industry is much more complicated as the analysis is done with global industries and laws in mind.\n\n\nThe industry life cycle is made up of the following stages:\n\n\nPioneering Phase\n\nGrowth Phase\n\nMature Growth Phase\n\nStabilization/Maturity Phase\n\nDeceleration/Decline Phase\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1)Pioneering Phase\nThis phase is characterized by low demand for the industry's product and large upstart costs. Industries in this phase are typically start-up firms, with large upfront costs and few sales.\n\n2) Growth Phase\nAfter the pioneering phase, an industry can transfer into the growth phase. The growth phase is characterized by little competition and accelerated sales. Industries in this phase have typically survived the pioneering phase and are beginning to recognize sales growth.\n\n3) Mature Growth Phase\nAfter the growth phase, an industry will reach the mature growth phase. The mature growth phase is characterized above average growth, but no longer accelerating growth. Industries in this phase now face increasing competition and, as a result, profit margins begin to erode.\n\n4) Stabilization/Maturity Phase\nAfter the growth phases, an industry will enter in the stabilization/maturity phase. The stabilization/maturity phase is characterized by growth that is now average. Industries in this phase have significant competition and the return on equity is now more normalized. This is typically the longest phase an industry will go through.\n\n5) Deceleration/Decline Phase\nThe deceleration follows the growth and maturity phases. The deceleration/decline phase is characterized by declining growth as demand shifts to other substitute (new) products. \n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_269", "text": "\n\nConcentration Ratio\r\nThe concentration ratio is the measure of the percentage market share in an industry held by the largest firms within that industry. For example, suppose 3 firms dominate a specific industry, such as beverages, holding 80% market share of the beverage industry. The concentration ratio of the beverage industry would thus be 80%.\n\nExample: Concentration ratio\nThe beverage industry is composed of 5 firms with market shares as follows: \n\nCo A has 30% market share\nCo B has 30% market share\nCo C has 20% market share\nCo D has 15% market share \nCo E has 5% market share.\n\nCalculate the concentration ratio for the beverage industry.\nAnswer: \nThe three-firm concentration ratio fro the beverage industry is 80% (30% + 30% + 20%).\n\nHerfindahl Index\nAnother measure of concentration in an industry can be expressed using the Herfindahl index. The Herfindahl index is simply the sum of the squares of the market shares for each firm within the industry and is always less than one.\n\nFormula 13.12\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nExample: Calculate the Herfindahl Index\nThe beverage industry comprises 5 firms with market shares as follows: \n\nCo A has 30% market share\nCo B has 30% market share\nCo C has 20% market share\nCo D has 15% market share \nCo E has 5% market share.\n\nCalculate the Herfindahl Index for the beverage industry.\n\nAnswer: \nThe Hefindahl Index is calculated as follows:\n\n(0.30)2 + (0.30)2 + (0.20)2 + (0.15)2 + (0.05)2 = 0.245\n\nThe Herfindahl index for the beverage industry is 0.245.\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_270", "text": "\n\nWhen analyzing an industry domestically, there are many elements to consider. There are additional elements to consider when preparing a global industry analysis. They are as follows:\n\n\nGovernment Policies\nGovernment policies can affect how industries relate to competition. Through government policies, the government can control competition. The open-skies laws, which restrict air transportation to foreign carriers, is an example of how governments can control competition. In this case, the governments are giving their domestic airlines an unfair advantage in the industry. Additionally, a government can alter industry competition through subsidies to domestic companies.\n\nMarket Competition\nWhen analyzing an industry or a global business, market competition is important to analyze. A firm needs not only be concerned with competition in its domestic market, but potential competition for other firms globally. A perfect example is the television industry. Not only do U.S. competitors need to be aware of what the local competition is doing, but they also have to keep an eye on other competitors worldwide.\n\nRivalry Intensity\nThis can be characterized as the degree of competition within an industry. As barriers to entry come down and government policies become more relaxed with respect to increased global competition, the intensity of competition will become more intense.\n\nCompetition Along the Value Chain\nInputs, whether they are raw materials or labor, are an important cost component of a firm's profitability. If competition for inputs intensifies as a result of the global competitive landscape, the more a company's profitability will erode.\n\n\nForces that Determine Industry Competition\nWhen analyzing an industry, it is important to determine what competitive forces affect the industry. Michael Porter discussed the concept of industry competition in numerous books and articles. He believes that there are 5 main competitive forces that drive industry competition:\n\n\nRivalry Among Existing Competitors.\nPorter believes that competition among existing firms must be analyzed with respect to (1) the intensity of competition and (2) whether the competition among existing firms is growing. \n\nThreat of New Entrants.\nWhen analyzing industry competition, it is not only important to analyze the existing competitors currently within the industry, but also any competition from a potential new entrant into the industry. This force can be analyzed by understanding an industry's barriers to entry.\n\nThreat of Substitute Products.\nFrom basic economics, it is understood that if a product has a substitute, the potential profit from that product is limited because consumers will switch to the substitute product if the initial product is too costly. In analyzing an industry, it is important to identify potential substitute products to determine the flexibility of demand within an industry.\n\nBargaining Power of Buyers.\nMuch like substitution, it is important to analyze the bargaining power of buyers and how that relates to the profitability of the industry. If the bargaining power of the buyers is high, the industry profitability will be driven by the buyers so that greater attention to a buyer's wants or needs, will determine competition within the industry.\n\nBargaining Power of Suppliers.\nSuppliers are an important factor in a company's competitiveness as they can alter the profitability of the company and industry. As such, it is important to determine who the suppliers to the industry are as well as the level of bargaining power the suppliers have. If the bargaining power of the suppliers is high, the industry profitability will be driven by the suppliers.\n\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_271", "text": "\n\n\nGrowth Company and Growth Stock\nA growth company is a company that consistently grows by investing in projects that will generate growth. A growth stock, however, is a stock that earns a higher rate of return over stocks with a similar risk profile. \n\nFeasibly, a company could be a growth company, but its stock could be a value stock if it is trading below its peers of similar risk.\n\n\n\nDefensive Company and Defensive Stock\nA defensive company is a company whose earnings are relatively unaffected in a business cycle downturn. A defensive company is typically reflective of products that we \"need\" versus \"want\". A food company, such as Kellogg, is considered a defensive company. A defensive stock, however, will hold its value relatively well in a business cycle downturn. \n\n\n\nCyclical Company and Cyclical Stock\nA cyclical company is a company whose earnings are affected relative to a business cycle. A cyclical company is typically reflects products we \"want\". A retail store, such as The Gap, is considered a cyclical company. A cyclical stock, however, will move with the market in relation to the business cycle.\n\n\n\nSpeculative Company and Speculative Stock.\nA speculative company is a company that invests in a business with an uncertain outcome. An oil exploration company is an example of a speculative company. A speculative stock, however, is a stock that has potential for a large return, as well as the potential for considerable losses. An example of speculative stocks can be found in the tech bubble, where investors put money into speculative stocks, but the investor could have been hurt financially or made large gains depending on the stock the investor invested in.\n\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_272", "text": "\n\nUnderlying Assumptions of Technical Analysis\nTechnical analysis is the practice of valuing stocks on past volume and pricing information. Technical analysis assumes the following:\n\n\nMarket value of the asset is a reflection of supply and demand of the asset.\n\nSupply and demand are driven by rational factors, such as data and economic analysis, as well as irrational factors, such as guesses.\n\nMarkets and individual stocks move together given trends.\n\nShifts in supply and demand will shift the trends in the market and can be detected in the market. \n\nIf the concept of technical analysis is new to you, be sure to review our Technical Analysis tutorial.\n\nTechnical vs. Fundamental Analysis\nThe main difference between technical analysis and fundamental analysis is the use of financial statements to value equities. Technical analysis is the practice of valuing stocks on past volume and pricing information. Technical analysis combines both the use of past information (how stocks have reacted previously) and \"feeling\" (how the market is moving the name) to value a security. \n\nFundamental analysis, however, takes a more formal approach. Fundamental analysts review the financial statements of a company and generate metrics, such as price-to-book value and enterprise value-to-EBITDA to value a security.\n\nAdvantages of Technical Analysis:\n\n\nTechnical analysis is easy to understand and can be performed relatively quickly, especially with the aid of one of the many types of charting software.\n\nTechnical analysis does not rely on the use of financial statements for valuation purposes.\n\nRather than strict fundamental valuation, technical analysis takes into account the \"feeling\" of the market, which is subjective.\n\nChallenges to Technical Analysis: \n\n\nThe past is not always an indication of future results, calling into question the validity of technical analysis.\n\nTechnical analysis violates the premise of EMH because EMH believers assume that price adjustments happen too quickly to be profitable.\n\nChallenges to Technical Analysis Trading Rules\n\n\nTechnical analysis is subjective and cannot be used to make consistent decisions.\n\nSignals that indicate action in technical analysis may change over time.\n\n\nTechnical indicators are categorized into the following:\n\n1. Contrary Opinion\nTraders that follow this type of analysis view the majority as being incorrect and choose the opposite direction. There are many indicators that can be followed:\n\n\nMutual fund cash positions - given a mutual funds holds a part of its assets as cash, traders monitor cash positions of mutual funds (reported monthly) and trade against them accordingly. To a trader, a large cash position in a mutual fund would be an indication to buy (mutual funds are bearish, hence trader would be bullish).\n\nInvestment advisory opinions - To a trader, a large number of bearish investment advisory opinions would indicate it was time to buy, again taking the contrary view.\n\nCBOE Put/Call Ratio - given a large put-to-call ratio would indicate that the market maintains a bearish view, the contrarian trader would take the opposite view and see it as a bullish indicator.\n\n2. Smart Money\nSome investors are deemed smarter than others and, therefore, their money is considered \"smart money\". Traders typically follow the smart money. The following are viewed as smart-money indicators.\n\n\nConfidence Index - This index is the average yield of the top 10 corporate bonds divided by the Dow Jones average yield of 40 bonds. A bullish indicator is when the yield spread narrows, indicating investors are willing to invest in risky bonds.\n\nMargin Debt - an increase in margin would indicate that investors are becoming more bullish.\n\n3. General Market\n\n\nBreadth of market - this is the measure of stock declines versus stock increases for the day, indicating direction (a technical indication for the market).\n\nShort interest - this is the measure of stocks sold short. If short interest increases, that is a bullish signal as investors will have to buy the stock to cover the shorts.\n\n4. Stock Price and Volume Techniques\n\n\nDow Theory - A theory which says the market is in an upward trend if one of its averages (industrial or transportation) advances above a previous important high, it is accompanied or followed by a similar advance in the other. The theory also says that when both averages dip below previous important lows, it's regarded as an indicator of a downward trend.\n\nSupport and Resistance - this is the view, given the psychological nature of investors, that a stock does not often trade above its support and resistance level. Traders monitor the levels for strategy. If a stock breaks out of its resistance level, it moves to the next resistance level. Learn more about these key technical indicators that not only display strength and weakness but also act as buy and sell indicators in the following article: Support & Resistance Basics\n\n\n\nMoving-average - this measures the average moves of a stock over a specified time period. This measure removes daily fluctuations in a price change and the trend can be more readily discerned. Take a closer look at the linearly weighted moving average and the exponentially smoothed moving average within the following article: Basics of Weighted Moving Averages\n\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_273", "text": "\n\nAdvantages of the ratios are as follows:\n\nPrice-to-Earnings (P/E)\n\n\nEasy to use\n\nMost commonly used measure of valuation\n\nStudies have indicated a strong correlation to long-term returns.\n\nPrice-to-Book Value (P/BV)\n\n\nTends to be a stable valuations metric because balance sheets do not fluctuate much quarter-to-quarter.\n\nCan be used as a valuation metric even when firms report an EPS loss.\n\nGood metric to value firms in distress\n\nPrice-to-Sales (P/S)\n\n\nSales tend to be a realistic number and are not influenced as heavily by accounting issues.\n\nGood metric to value firms in distress.\n\nCan be used as a valuation metric when firms report a loss.\n\nPrice-to- Cash Flow (P/CF)\n\n\nCash flow is a truer metric of a company's results in comparison to earnings.\n\nIt is more difficult for managements to manipulate cash flow - tends to be less volatile than earnings.\n\nStudies have indicated that it is a reliable metric over the longer-term.\n\n\nDrawbacks for each multiple are as follows:\n\nPrice-to-Earnings (P/E)\n\n\nCannot be used for firms when they report a loss in earnings.\n\nEarnings can be volatile given various inputs.\n\nEarnings are more easily manipulated by managements.\n\nPrice-to-Book Value (P/BV)\n\n\nDoes not take into account the relative asset size when comparing firms.\n\nAccounting metrics can skew the results.\n\nBook value is not an accurate measure of actual market value.\n\nPrice-to-Sales (P/S)\n\n\nSales do not always translate to profits which can leave out the cost component.\n\nDifficult to value companies with different cost structures.\n\nAccounting issues related to revenue recognition can still alter sales.\n\nPrice-to- Cash Flow (P/CF)\n\n\nSome items are not included, such as non-cash revenue.\n\nUsing the following data on Newco and Oldco, determine each company's P/E, P/BV, P/S and P/CF ratios and then interpret the results.\n\nData for Newco and Oldco\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGiven the above results, Newco appears to be undervalued relative to Oldco on the basis of the P/E ratio.

It is a legal document that states what the issuer can and cannot do, and states the bondholders rights. Since there tends to be a ton of legalese involved, the contract is managed by the corporate trustee who polices the actions of the issuer to ensure the rights of the bondholder are upheld.\nWithin the indenture, there are affirmative and negative covenants:\n\n\nAffirmative Covenants \nAffirmative covenants are what the issuer promises to do for the investor. These promises include things such as paying interest and principle in a  timely manner; paying taxes and other expenses when due; maintaining the assets backing the bond and issuing reports to the trustee to ensure compliance.\n\nNegative Covenants\nNegative convents are the restraints put on a borrower. These restraintsinclude issuing additional securities or taking on additional debt that may  harm the current bondholders. This is generally done without meeting certaintests and/or ratios or receiving permission from the current bondholders.\n\n\nBasic Features of Bonds\nIn order to better understand more complicated topics, the CFA Institute requires CFA candidates to have the ability to describe the basic features of a bond. These features include:\n\r\n1. Maturity\nMaturity is the time at which the bond matures and the holder receives the final payment of principal and interest. The \"term to maturity\" is the amount of time until the bond actually matures. There are 3 basic classes of maturity:\n\n\nA. Short-Term Maturity - One to five years in length\n\nB.Intermediate-Term Maturity - Five to twelve years in length\n\nC. Long-Term Maturity - Twelve years or more in length\n\nMaturity is important because:\n\n\nIt indicates the length of time in which an investor will receive interest as well as when he or she will receive principal payments.\n\nIt affects the yield on the bond; longer maturities tend to yield higher rates.\n\nThe price volatility of a bond is a function of its maturity. A longer maturity typically indicates higher volatility or, in Wall Street lingo, simply the \"vol\".\n\n2. Par Value\nPar value is the dollar amount the holder will receive at the bond's maturity. It can be any amount but is typically $1,000 per bond. Par value is also known as principle, face, maturity or redemption value. Bond prices are quoted as a percentage of par.\n\nExample: Premiums and Discounts\nImagine that par for ABC Corp. is $1000, which would =100. If the ABC Corp. bonds trade at 85 what would the dollar value of the bond be? What if ABC Corp. bonds at 102?\n\nAnswer:\nAt 85, the ABC Corp. bonds would trade at a discount to par at $850. If ABC Corp. bonds at 102, the bonds would trade at a premium of $1,020.\n\n3. Coupon Rate\nA coupon rate states the interest rate the bond will pay the holders each year. To find the coupon's dollar value, simply multiply the coupon rate by the par value. The rate is for one year and payments are usually made on a semi-annual basis. Some asset-backed securities pay monthly, while many international securities pay only annually. The coupon rate also affects a bond's price. Typically, the higher the rate, the less price sensitivity for the bond price because of interest rate movements. \n\n4. Currency Denomination\nCurrency denomination indicates what currency the interest and principle will be paid in. There are two main types:\n\n\nDollar Denominated - refers to bonds with payment in USD.\n\nNondollar-Denominated - denotes bonds in which the payments are in another currency besides USD.\n\nOther currency denomination structures can use various types of currencies to make payments.\n\nBecause the provisions for redeeming bonds and options that are granted to the issuer or investor are more complicated topics, we will discuss them later in this LOS section.\n\nExample: Bond Table\nLet's take a look at an example of a bond with the features we've discussed so far, within a bond table format you'd see in a paper.\n\nABC Corp 7.00% 6/1/10 at 90.\n\nThe issuer is ABC Corp.\nThe maturity is 2010 with a term to maturity of roughly 5 years.\r\nPar value is 1,000 per bond or 100\r\nCoupon rate is 7%.\r\nCoupon Payment is $70 per year (coupon=coupon rate* par value = .07 *$1,000 = $70\r\nTrading Price in dollars in $900.00 (par price * .90)\nABC Corp is a U.S. company and all payments of interest ant principle are inUSD.\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_276", "text": "\n\nMake sure that you understand the various coupon rate structures that can be developed in the bond market. Let's discuss each in detail:\n\n\nZero-Coupon Bonds - These instruments pay no interest to the holder and are issued at a deep discount. As the bond nears maturity, its price increases to reach par value. At maturity, the bondholder will receive the par price. The interest earned is the difference between the purchase price of the bond and what the holders receives at maturity.\n\nStep-up Notes - The interest rate of these bonds increases or \"steps-ups\" at a stated date(s). The rate may remain at this level until maturity and in this case would be considered a \"single step-up note\". Step-up notes can also have a series of rate increases and are then referred to as \"multiple step-up notes\".\n\nDeferred Coupon Bonds - A structure that essentially incorporates features of both a zero coupon bond and a coupon paying bond. These bonds typical do not pay interest for the first couple of years. After this period the cash interest accrues at a stated rate and is usually paid semi-annually to the bondholders. The coupon rate is typically higher than other issues in order to entice investors to purchase these issues. Companies in the high yield arena typically issue these bonds to conserve their cash flows in the earlier years of their business life.\n\nFloating-Rate Bonds - These bonds have coupon rates that reset at predetermined times. The rate is usually based on an index or benchmark with some sort of spread added or subtracted to the benchmark.\n\nStructure of Floating-Rate Bonds\nTo find the coupon rate of floating rate bonds, all one has to find out is what the benchmark or reference rate is trading at and add or subtract the stated amount of basis points or other influencing variable. Let's take a closer look at the above example of the Federal Fund Floater:\n\nExample: Floating Rate Security: Federal Funds\nAssume the coupon rate of a floating-rate bond is based on the Federal Funds rate plus 25 basis points at three-month intervals. If the Federal Funds are at 3%, what would the coupon rate for this bond be?\n\nFormula 14.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoupon rate = Reference Rate + influencing variable.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer: \nCoupon rate = 3% (Fed Funds) + 25 basis points.\nCoupon rate = 3.25%\nThe coupon rate for this bond would be 3.25% until the next reset date. Floating- rate securities come in many forms. Other forms of floating-rate securities involve caps and floors; these are discussed in detail below.\n\nCaps and Floors\nSome floating-rate securities have restrictions placed on how high or how low the coupon rate can become.\n\n\nCaps -  state how high the coupon rate can go. Once it hits that level, there can be no further increase in the rate. Caps are less advantageous for investors because the rate can only keep pace with market rates up to a point. On the other hand, they protect the issuer by keeping the cost of borrowing below a certain level.\n\nExample: Caps \nReferring back to our Federal Funds example, let's add a cap of 3.90 % and assume that Fed Funds are trading at 3.75%. What is the coupon rate?\n\nAnswer:\nCoupon rate = 3.75%(Fed Funds) + 25 basis points.\nCoupon rate = 4.00%\n\n\nEven though the formula states a 4% coupon should be paid this period, the  cap holds the coupon at 3.90%.\n\n\nFloor - states how low a coupon rate can go. Once the coupon rate hits the floor, it can no longer decline beyond that point. Floors are more advantageous to investors because as rates continue to decrease, the investor is protected from that decrease at a stated point.\n\n\nExample: Floors\nNow lets add a floor of 2% and assume that Fed Funds are trading at 1.50% \n\nAnswer: Coupon rate = 1.50% (Fed Funds) + 25 basis points\nCoupon rate = 1.75%\n\nEven though the formula states a 1.75% coupon should be paid, there is a 2% floor in place, which means that the investor will receive 2% instead of the 1.75% derived from the formula.\n\nAccrued Interest and Price Terminology\n\n\nAccrued interest - the amount of interest that builds up in between coupon payments that will be received by the buyer of the bond when a sale occurs between these coupon payments, even though the seller of the bonds earned it.\n\nFull Price - is sometimes referred to as a bond's dirty price, which is the amount the buyer will pay the seller. It equals the negotiated price of the bond plus the accrued interest.\n\nClean Price - is simply the price of the bond without the accrued interest.\n\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_277", "text": "\n\nA bond generally have two main maturity structures:\n\n\nBullet Maturity - Most corporate and government bonds use this structure, which requires the borrower to pay the investor one lump sum of the principle on the stated maturity date.\n\n\n\nAmortizing Securities - Asset-Backed Securities (ABSs) along with Mortgage Backed Securities (MBSs) have structures that pay the principal back at certain intervals during the bond's life. For example, a mortgage payment includes part principle and part interest. They are called amortizing securities because the principle amount shrinks as the security matures, so that the last payment made to the investors closes out the issuer's responsibility concerning this bond.\n\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_278", "text": "\n\nThe provisions for redeeming bonds are found in the indenture. They can be:\n\n1.Called\n2.Refunded\n3.Have Prepayment Options and/or\n4.Sinking Fund Provisions\n\n1. Call Redemption\nBy adding a call feature in the indenture, a bond becomes a callable bond. A callable bond gives the issuer the right to redeem the bonds on a stated date or a schedule of dates before the stated maturity date for the bonds arrives.\n\nLet's look at callable bonds in a little more detail. First, some terminology:\n\n\nCall Price - This is the price that the issuer will pay the bondholder; also know as the redemption price.\n\nCall Date - This is the date or dates that the issuer can call the bond from the holders.\n\nDeferred Call - When a callable bond is originally issued, it is said to have a deferred call of so many years up to the first call date, which is the first day the bond can be called by the issuer.\n\n\nRedemption Pricing\n\n\nRegular or General Redemption Prices - These price tend to be above par until the first par call date. The price is typically known before the redemption occurs.\n\nSpecial Prices - These occur because of certain events such as sinking funds, repossessions, forced sales, and eminent domain. These usually occur at par value but could be less, depending on the collateral backing the bonds.\n\nCalling Bonds\nWhen callable bonds are called, it can be for the entire issue or for just a part of it. A partial call can be done on a random basis, like picking numbers out of a hat, or on a pro rata basis. A pro rata call allows all holders to redeem a certain percentage of their holdings while with a random, partial call it could be anyone's guess as to which bonds will be called by the issuer.\n\nPrice can be determined as a fixed price, regardless of dates, based on a predetermined schedule of dates in which price decreases as it nears the bond's maturity date, as well as through a make whole call.\n\nExample: Call Redemption\nLet's use the Stone and Co 12's of 20, or Stone and Co 12% bonds of 2020 to illustrate a scheduled call.\n\nFixed price regardless of date:\nThis call provision allows the bond to be called at par plus interest at any date past Jan.1, 2010.\n\nPrice based on Schedule.\nThis call provision bases its price on stated dates with the price decreasing as the bond nears maturity.\n\nJan 1. 2010 Price = 103 or $1,030 based on a par value of 100\n\nJan 1. 2012 Price = 102 or $1,020 based on a par value of 100\n\nJan 1. 2015 Price = 101.5 or $1,015 based on a par value of 100\n\nPrice based on a Make-Whole Premium\nThis structure incorporates various formulas that can be structured to develop the price. The formula is structured to protect the yield the investor had been receiving on his bond. \n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_279", "text": "\n\n2. Refunding\r\nThe refunding of an issue is the replacement of a current high coupon rate bond. This is done by issuing newer bonds at a lower coupon rate. With regards to a callable issue, refunding offers little protection to a holder. At least with a callable bond the holder has a date on which the call will occur. The refunding could occur as soon as it becomes advantageous to the issuer to replace older, higher rate bonds.\n\n3. Prepayments\nThis form of redemption occurs in ABS and MBS securities. In this instance the investor could receive additional principal payments before the maturity date. For example, a homeowner with a mortgage payment of $500 a month could pay more than that amount, say $700 a month. This additional $200 would constitute a prepayment of principal. If this were to happen in the payment of a bond, the bond would be redeemed before maturity.\n\n4. Sinking Fund Provisions\nThis helps redeem and retire bonds. It requires an issuer to retire or pay for the retirement of a specific portion of the issue at certain times. This helps reduce credit risk by having something in the \"kitty\" each year as a protection against a default.

Because these options carry some sort of value, they can have a dramatic effect on the price of a security's cash flow as well as its total return.\n\nOptions that Benefit the Issuer:\n\n\nCall options - allows the issuer to call the bonds prior to maturity if prevailing rates decrease enough to make it economically feasible for the issuer to replace the existing issue (consisting of higher rate coupons) with lower coupon bonds.\n\nPrepayments - the benefit of prepayment is the same as a call option, in that it allows a company to end a contract early.\n\nCaps - Acap puts a lid on the amount that an issuer has to pay in the face of rising interest rates, when their bonds coupon is based on a floating interest rate.\n\nOptions that Benefit the Holder\n\n\nPuts - This option is the exact opposite of a call. It allows the bondholder to sell the bond or \"put\" the bond back to the issuer at a certain price and date(s) before its maturity. As rates rise, this helps the bondholders dump their holdings and reinvest their proceeds at a higher rate.\n\nFloor - As mentioned earlier, a floor enables a firm to set a limit on how low the payment of their coupon can be. This benefits the holder because as rates decrease, it holds their interest payment at a certain level even as market rates decline below the floor level.\n\nConversion Privilege - This allows the bondholders to exchange their current bond with equity in the same firm using convertible bonds. They may also receive equity or fixed income securities in another firm by the use of exchangeable bonds. This benefits the holder because if the equity or other securities of the firm is outperforming the bonds, the bonds can be converted, allowing the holder to realize a higher return.\n\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_281", "text": "\n\nInstitutional investors tend to finance their purchases in two ways instead of purchasing securities outright. They are:\n\n\nBuying on Margin - In this form of financing the buyer borrows funds from a broker/dealer who in turn gets the cash from a bank. The institution is charged an interest rate plus some additional charges for using this method. Regulations T and U, as well as the Securities Act of 1934, limit the degree to which the margin can be extended to the buyer.\n\nRepurchase Agreements - These are collateralized loans in which the institution sells a security with the commitment to purchase the same security at a later date. The length of time could be as short as overnight or extend all the way to the maturity of the security. The price that is agreed upon is the repurchase price and the institution is charged a repo rate. The repo rate is an implied interest rate, which is the cost that the institution incurs for funding the position. Its benefit is that it is a very cheap way to finance a position because the repo rate tends to be set around the Federal Funds rate.\n\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_282", "text": "\n\nInterest rate risk is concerned with a decline in the price of a bond or a portfolio of bonds due to an increase in market rates. As rates increase, bond prices decline and vice versa.\n\nThe features of a bond affect the bond's interest rate in the following ways:\n\n\nMaturity - The longer the maturity of the bond, the more sensitive it is to interest rate movements. The reason for this effect is that more cash flows will be affected over a longer period of time.\n\nCoupon Rates - Lower coupon rates are more sensitive to interest rates. Why? If your bond is paying 4% and rates are in an upward swing, the difference in the market yield and your yield will continue to widen, which will push your bond values down.\n\nEmbedded Options - As interest rates decline the value of the option becomes more valuable to the issuing company. The price will increase as rates decline but will be held at the call or redemption price. This is because as rates decline it will become more likely that the issuer will call the bonds and that the holder will only receive the call price and not a true market price. Likewise, when rates rise the price will not drop as much because the option will maintain some sort of value when compared to a bond with no options.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLook Out!\n\n\n\n\nRecognize that the various bond features work with or against each other in determining a bond's price volatility.\n\n\n\n\nAs market yield volatility increases, the interest rate risk increases. This is because there is a greater chance of rates breaking out of their current ranges, either by rising or declining. Typically, as rates increase there is a greater chance of this risk occurring because market prices of bonds will decline as interest rates rise.\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_283", "text": "\n\nCall and prepayment risk is concerned with the holders having their bonds paid off earlier than the maturity date.

It can also occur when the borrowers in a MBS or ABS refinance or pay off their debt earlier than the stated maturity date.\n\nDisadvantages of Investing in Bonds that are Callable or Prepayable\n\n1. It is difficult to develop and forecast the cash flows for the security because of the possible early redemption of the bond.\n\n2. The reinvestment risk is another disadvantage. As rates decrease and bond are called or prepaid, investors will not be able to invest their proceeds at the old rates and will have to use new, lower market rates to put their cash to work.\n\n3. Price compression is the final disadvantage for investors. When rates decline there is a greater chance that the issuer will call the bonds. This compresses or holds the bond at its call price while bonds without this option will continue to increase in market value as rates continue to decrease.\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_284", "text": "\n\nReinvestment risk is the risk that the proceeds from the payment of principal and interest, which have to be reinvested at a lower rate than the original investment.\n\n\nCall features affect an investor's reinvestment risk because corporations typically call their bonds in a declining interest rate environment. This allows them to finance their operations at a cheaper rate, but the investor also has to take those proceeds and invest them at lower rates.\n\nAmortizing securities have even greater reinvestment risk. Since the investor is receiving both interest and principle payments each month, they have to continue to invest a greater amount of proceeds than with a regular type of bond. Also, the investor is exposed to prepayment risk as rates decline because mortgage and credit card holders can refinance their debt at lower levels.\n\nZero coupon bonds have no reinvestment risk because there are no coupon payments made to the investor. Because of the lower coupon rate, however, zeros expose the investor to a higher interest rate risk.\n\nBecause amortizing securities pay part of their principal with regular interest payments, investors receive the maturity value in installments in a current period. Non-amortizing securities make their payment at a later maturity date. If prevailing interest rates are declining, holders of amortizing securities have to reinvest their coupons and portion of principal at a lower rate. Meanwhile, the non-amortizing securities offer the holder some protection by holding the principal payment off until a later date. This enables the non-amortizing holder to maintain a higher rate at a longer period of time and reduces the reinvestment risk for a portion of his or her holdings\n\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_285", "text": "\n\nThe yield curve risk is how your portfolio will react with different exposures based on how the yield curve shifts. \n\n\nInvestors portfolios tend to move in a parallel shift on the yield curve. This happens when all maturities on the yield curve move by an equal amount. The yield curve encompasses all maturities in the fixed income market. In a parallel shift, the investor would see an increase or decrease in all maturities by, for example, 25 basis points.\n\nIn the real world, however, the yield curve does not move this way. The curve tends to steepen, or yield an increase in the long end of the curve compared to shorter issues. The curve can also flatten,with yield on the long end decreasing at a faster rate than at the short end of the curve.\n\nBecause any measure of interest-rate risk assumes an equal amount of basis point moves on the yield curve, anything will be an approximation of how an investor's portfolio will react. The risk involved here is the degree to which this approximation will not match of the actual yield curve movement.\n\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_286", "text": "\n\r\n1. Default Risk - Default risk is the risk that the issuer will go belly up and not be able to pay its obligations of interest and principle. To help measure this risk, an investor can look at default rates. A default rate is the percentage of a population of bonds that are expected to default. Another ratio that an investor can look at is the recovery rate. This rate indicates how much and investor can expect to get back if a default occurs.\n\r\n2. Credit Spread Risk - This second type of credit risk deals with how the spread of an issue over the treasury curve will react. For example, Ford five-year bonds may trade at 50 basis points above the current five-year treasury. If the five-year bond is trading at 3.5%, then the Ford bonds are trading at a yield of 4%. If this spread of 50 bps widens out compared to other bond issues, it would mean that the Ford bonds are not performing as well as the other bonds in the marketplace. Spreads tend to widen in poor performing economies. \n\r\n3. Downgrade Risk - The third type of credit risk deals with the rating agencies. These agencies, such as Moody's, S&P and Fitch, give an issuer a rating or grade that indicates the possibility of default. On the more secure side, the ratings range from AAA, which is the best rating to AA, A, BBB. These are the ratings for investment-grade bonds. Once bonds dip into the BB, B, CCC ranges they become junk bonds or, in politically correct language, high yield securities. If one of these rating agencies downgrades a company's rating, it may be harder for the corporation to pay. This will typically cause its marker value to decrease.

If the market is deep, an investor can purchase or sell a security at current prices. If the market is not liquid, it is harder to sell or buy a security at the last market price.\n\nLiquidity is typically measured by the bid/ask spread. If the spread is wide, the market is illiquid. If the spread is narrow, the market is more liquid.\n\nLiquidity risk is important because it tells you how easily you can get rid of a position if you need to close it near the last market price.\n\nThis is even more important if you plan to hold a security to maturity because of the marking to market of your positions. In an illiquid market, it may be hard to obtain quotes, and when you revalue the security it could be well below market prices, affecting the reports you send to clients and management.\n\nThis risk also changes over time, so a manager has to keep abreast of this risk.

This is because the payment of interest and principal will be in a foreign currency. When investors receive that currency, they have to go into the foreign currency markets and sell it to purchase their home currency. The risk is that their foreign currency will be devalued compared to the currency of their home countries and that they will receive less money than they expected to receive.\n\nAs an example, suppose that a U.S. investor purchases a Euro denominated bond. When the interest payment comes due and if the Euro has declined in value compared to USD, the investor will receive less in USD than expected when he or she transacts in the foreign currency markets. In short, the investor will receive fewer Euros to purchase USD.\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_289", "text": "\n\nVolatility risk involves bonds with embedded options.

This will occur because investors will be willing to pay up on the bonds price to achieve the additional yield. As investors continue to buy the bond, the yield will decrease until it reaches market equilibrium. Remember that as yield decrease, bond prices rise.\n\nIf a bond's coupon rate is below the yield required by the market, the bond will trade below its par value or at a discount. This happens because investors will not buy this bond at par when other issues are offering higher coupon rates, so yields will have to increase, which means the bond price will drop in order to induce investors to purchase these bonds. Remember that as yields increase, bond prices fall.\n\n\nThe relationship between the price of a callable bond, an option free bond, and the price of the embedded call option\nThe price of a callable bond will always be truncated when compared to an option- free bond. This is because a bond with a call option will have a set price at which the bond can be called. An option-free bond does not, and it could trade into higher prices than the stated call price of the embedded option bond. \n\nExample:\nYou have two bonds that are alike except one of them can be called this year at a price of $102. If market rates decline, the price of both bonds will increase. The option free bond could trade up to $105, however. This is because of the possibility that the callable bond will be called by the issuer and, therefore, it will tend to hold the dollar price at the call price of $102. Why would you buy this bond at $105 when you will only receive $102 if the issuer calls the bond?\n\nThe price of the embedded call option will rise when interest rates decrease. This is because as rates decrease, the possibility that the bonds will be called increases, which adds value to the call option. As the price of the call option increases, the dollar price of the callable bond will decrease or be maintained at the call price.\n\nWhen market rates increase, both issues will tend to decline in value lock step. This is because there will be less of a chance that the bonds will be called; this will make the callable bond act like an option free bond. The price of the option will also decrease, which will also make it trade and be valued more like an option free bond.\n\nInterest Rate Risk of a Floating-Rate Security\nAlthough a floating rate helps to reduce interest-rate risk because of the reset of the rate at periodic times; the price can fluctuate for three reasons:\n\n1. The longer the reset period, the greater the potential price movements will be. The basis is the same as it is for a fixed-rate bond. The longer the time to maturity or the longer to reset, the more market events can affect the price of the bond.\n\n2. The required margin could change. For example, let's say that when an investor originally purchases a bond, the spread over the index that was required by the market was 15 basis points. Because of market events, however, the spread that is required by the market is now 45 basis points. This would cause the floater's price to decline. The opposite would occur if the spread came in to 5 basis points.\n\n3. Floaters usually come with caps. Once this cap value is breached, the reset interest rate can no longer go above a certain level. This will cause it to act much like a fixed-rate security in a rising interest rate environment, meaning the value of the floater will decrease because it can't keep up with current market rates. \n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_293", "text": "\nDuration is an estimated measure of the price sensitivity of a bond to a change in interest rates. It can be stated as a percentage or in dollar amounts. It can be helpful to \"shock\" or analyze what will happen to a bond when market rates increase or decrease. Example:Let's assume that the calculation yields a duration of 6.14, this means that if interest rates change, the value of the bond will change by 6.14%. If  there is a 50 basis point change, the value will change by 3.07% and for a 25 basis point change would equal a 1.53% change.Calculating DurationThe easiest way to calculate duration or the percentage price change is to average the percentage price change coming from an equal increase and decrease in interest rates measured in basis points. To compute duration one needs to develop a valuation model to determine the new prices. The duration value is only as good as the valuation model. Example:Stone & Co. bonds are selling at 95, yielding 5.25%Let's assume that yields increase by 25bps, causing the price to decline to 93.  Therefore, the price changes by 2.1%. Then, take 2.1% and divide it by 25bps equaling a .084% change. This represents a 1 basis points move.Now let's assume that yields decrease by 25bps, causing the price to increaseto 98. The price change is now 3.06%.Then, take 3.06% and divide it by 25bps equaling a .1224% change. This represents a 1 basis points move.As a final step, just average the two percentage price changes for a 1 basis points move in rates.Answer:Here's how the calculation should look: Duration = (.084 + .1224)/2 = .1032 = price change of 10.32%  (.1032*100).Formula 15.4\n\n\nDuration = Price if yield decline - Price if yield increase / 2 * (initial price) *change in yield in decimals\n\n\nAs such:98-93/ 2*95*.0025 = 10.52Approximate Percentage Price Change of a Bond Given a Change in DurationLet's continue with the above duration of 10.52. This would equal a percentage price change of 10.52 % for a change of 100 basis points in either direction. If the basis points change were 50, then the percentage price change would be 5.26% (10.52/2). If it were a 25bps change, the value would be 2.63% (10.52 / 4).Approximate New Price of a Bond Given the Duration and New Yield LevelLet's return once again to working with a duration of 10.52. This time, we'll add a total market value of the Stone & Co bonds of $10,000,000. Assume that the rates change by 100 bps. This would cause the value of the bonds to change by $ 1,052,000 ($10,000.000 *.1052). This is also known as dollar duration.The price will then range from $11,052,000 to $8,948,000.If rates increase by 50 basis points, however, the dollar change would be $526,000 giving the bonds a price range of $ 10,526,000 to $ 9,474,000.Duration and Yield-Curve Risk for a Portfolio of Bonds Portfolios have different exposures to how the yield curve shifts. These differences represent yield-curve risk. Because a portfolio tends to have different maturities, if there is not a parallel movement of rates or an equal amount of change in the yield curve across all maturities of the yield, the durations for the different maturities will not react in the same manner. Therefore, the simple procedure discussed above concerning duration will not be able to be applied to the entire portfolio, but will have to be applied over the different maturities as well as to the amount of rate changes in those maturities. \n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_294", "text": "\n\nIn general, a country has two bond markets: An Internal Market and an External Bond Market.\n\nThe internal market is the mechanism for trading securities within the country in which the issuers are based. This includes the country's domestic and foreign markets. \n\nThere are several types of international bonds traded on the External Market:\n\n\nForeign Bonds - Bonds by issuers who do not reside in the country where they are issued and traded. An example of a foreign would be a bond that is issued by a non-U.S. entity but then trades in the U.S. market. Such bonds can be issued in any currency and can have colorful nicknames such as \"Yankee Bonds\", which are foreign bonds issued in the U.S., or \"Bulldog Bonds\", which are sterling-denominated bonds traded in the U.K. foreign bond mark. One last type of a foreign bond is a Supranational. These bonds are issued when two or more central governments issue foreign bonds to promote economic development for the member countries. These include bonds issued by the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, or World Bank, and the International American Development Bank.\n\n\n\nEurobonds - Bonds are bonds issued in a different currency denomination than that of the country in which the bond is issued. Eurobonds are considered the external market for a country, or its international bond market. They are classified by their currency denomination. For example, Eurodollars are denominated in USD while a Euroyen bond would be denominated in Japanese Yen. All Eurobonds have four features:\n\n\n\nUnderwritten by an international syndicate\n\nWhen issued, offered simultaneously to investors in a number of countries\n\nIssued outside the jurisdiction of any single country\n\nThey are in unregistered form.\n\n\n\nGlobal Bonds - A bond that is issued and traded in the foreign bond market of one or more countries as well as in the Eurobond market\n\n\n\nSovereign Bonds - Bonds issued by a country's central government. Sovereign bonds tend to be the largest sector of a bond market in any country. They can be issued in their home country, the Eurobond market or the foreign sector of another country. They are typically denominated in the home country's currency, however, they are not required to be. They also have two different ratings: \n\n\n\nLocal Currency Debt Rating\n\nForeign Currency Debt Rating\n\nWhy two different ratings? The defaults of the bonds tend to differ based on the currency denomination. In general, there are greater defaults on the foreign currency denominated debt. The reason for this is that a government can raise taxes and can control its own financial system. When dealing with a foreign currency, this element of control is lost because the foreign currencies are purchased in the open market. Therefore, if the local currency has depreciated in the markets as compared to the foreign currency, it will be that much harder for an issuer to pay off his obligation.\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_295", "text": "\n\nThe U.S. Government issues four types of securities:\n\n1.Treasury Bills - Treasury bills have a maturity of less than 12 months, no coupon rate, are issued at a discount to par value, mature at par value and pay no coupon interest.

They have a coupon rate set by the market place at issue. They are issued approximately at par value and mature at par value.\n\n3.Treasury Bonds - Treasury bonds are the same as treasury notes except that they have maturities that are greater than ten years. The U.S. Government has not issued this type of bond for a while, but there are still some issues that are outstanding.\n\n4.Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS) - TIPS are issued as notes or bonds and help to protect the investor against inflation risk. The example below illustrates how these securities work.\n\nExample:\n\n\nThe coupon rate on an issue is set at a fixed rate, which is determined when the bonds are auctioned.\n\nThis is considered the \"real rate\" because it is what the investor will earn over the inflation rate.\n\nThe inflation index the government uses is the non-seasonally adjusted U.S. City Average All Item Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U)\n\nThese indexes work in deflationary environments as well, but the government has structured them so that the investor receives the higher inflation-adjusted amount, or par value, when redeemed at a later date.\n\nNow on to the number crunching part concerning TIPS:\n\nCoupon Rate = 4%\nAnnual Inflation Rate = 2%\nInvestor buys 1,000,000.00 USD of TIPS\n\nAt the end of the first six months the investor's coupon she will receive:\nInflation rate (2%/2) =1%\nCoupon rate (4%/2) = 2%\n\nAnswer:\nInflation adjusted principle amount = (par value x 1+ semi-annual inflation rate) = 1,000,000 x 1.01 = 1,010,000.00\n\nCoupon Payment = (Inflation adjusted principle amount x semi-annual coupon rate) = 1,010,000 x .02 = 20,200.00\n\nNow let's move ahead another six months:\n\nCoupon rate= 4% or 2% in semi-annual terms\nInflation rate = 3 % or 1.5 % in semi-annual terms\n\nInflation adjusted principle amount = (new par value x 1 + semi-annual inflation rate) = 1,010,000 x 1.015 = 1,025,150\n\nCoupon Payment = (Inflation adjusted principle amount x semi-annual coupon rate) = 1,025,250 x .02 = 20,503.00\n\nOn-the-run vs. Off-the-run Government Securities\n\nOn-the-run Securities\nOn-the-run securities are the most current security issued by the U.S.Treasury Department. These issues tend to be more liquid in the marketplace.\n\nOff-the-run Securities \nOff-the-run securities are the securities that are replaced by the on-the-run securities. These issues tend to be less liquid in the marketplace.\n\nHow Stripped Government Securities, & Coupon and Principal Strips Are Created\nThe U.S. government does not issue zero coupon notes and bonds and there is a strong demand for an instrument with no credit risk and a maturity of greater than one year. Based on consumer demand, therefore, the private sector created securities with these features.\n\n\nLet's look at a treasury bond that has five years to maturity with a coupon rate of 7 %. This constitutes ten interest payments of US$70 based on $1,000 par value and one principal payment of $1,000 for a total of 11 payments.\n\nYou now can discount these 11 single payments and create zero coupon instruments with maturity dates that correspond with the payment dates of the Treasury securities.\n\nThese are issued through the Treasury's Separate Trading and Registered Interest and Principal Securities (STRIPS) program to facilitate the stripping process. The zero-coupon securities created are the obligations of the U.S. Government.\n\nThese securities come in two different forms:\n\n1. Coupon Strips \nCoupon strips come from the coupon payment part of the security.\n\n2. Principal Strips\nPrincipal strips come from the principal payment.\n\nThe difference between coupon strips and principal strips, besides maturity dates and amount received, has to do with taxes. Coupon strips accrue interest and are taxed each year even though interest is not paid until maturity. This causes negative cash flows for a taxable entity. Foreign investors often like principal strips because of the preferred tax treatments they can receive in their home countries.\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_296", "text": "\nAn investment instrument that represents ownership of an undivided interest in a group of mortgages.

The mortgage gives the lender the right to take a property in case the borrower fails to make the payments on his loan, thus ensuring that the debt is paid off.

The investor in an MBS does not receive the full payment made by the borrower because the issuer charges servicing fees for doing the administrative work and prepayments.\nExample:\nLet's look at a $150,000 mortgage with a mortgage rate of 6%, a monthly payment of $1,000 and a term of 30 years or 360 months.\n\u00a0\n\n\t\t\tMonth\n\n\t\t\tBeginning Month\n\t\t\tMortgage Balance\n\n\t\t\tMortgage\n\t\t\tPayment\n\n\t\t\tInterest\n\n\t\t\tScheduled Principle Repayment\n\n\t\t\tEnd of Month Mortgage Balance\n\n\t\t\t1 \n\n\t\t\t$150,000\n\n\t\t\t$1,000\n\n\t\t\t$750\n\n\t\t\t$250\n\n\t\t\t$149,750\n\n\t\t\t2\n\n\t\t\t$149,750\n\n\t\t\t$1,000\n\n\t\t\t$748.75\n\n\t\t\t$251\n\n\t\t\t$149,498.75\n\n\t\t\t3\n\n\t\t\t$149,498.75\n\n\t\t\t$1,000\n\n\t\t\t$747.49\n\n\t\t\t$252.51\n\n\t\t\t$149,246.62\n\nThis process continues until the mortgage balance reaches zero, either by the scheduled payments or through any sort of prepayment. As you can see the interest decreases through the term of the loan as the mortgage balance decreases. This also means that that as the loan matures, more of the scheduled mortgage payment is applied to the mortgage balance.\nPrepayment\nPrepayment occurs when a bond's payments to its holders incorporates both interest and principal. Typically, in asset-backed securities (ABS) and Mortgage-backed securities (MBS) there is always a chance for a prepayment. To go back to an old example, a homeowner may only have to pay $500 a month on his mortgage, but decide to pay $700 a month. This additional amount is an example of prepayment. It can occur in chunks like this or it may be paid off in one lump sum.\nRisk of Prepayment\nThe risk of prepayment is that they typically occur in declining rate environments. When this happens, individuals tend to refinance their mortgages or credit cards at lower rates, causing the securities that were made of these obligations to be prepaid before their stated maturity date. This causes the investors in these securities to have to reinvest their proceeds at a lower market rate.\n\u00a0\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_297", "text": "\n\nCentral governments can develop entities that issue bonds. These securities are referred to as semi-government bonds or government agency bonds. In the U.S. they are referred to as federal agency securities. \nThe agency bond market can be further broken down into two categories:\n\n1. Federally Related Institutions\nFederally related institutions are arms of the federal government. They include Export-Import, Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), Government National Mortgage Association (Ginnie Mae). With exception to TVA and the Private Export Funding Corp., these securities are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government.\n\n2. Government Sponsored Enterprises (GSEs)\nGovernment sponsored enterprises are privately owned, publicly chartered entities that were developed to help lower the cost of funding in certain sectors of the marketplace that the government feels are important enough to warrant assistance. \n\nThey include the more familiar names such as:\n\n\nFederal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) - provides credit for the residential housing sector.\n\nFederal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) - provides credit for the residential housing sector.\n\nFederal Home Loan Bank - provides credit for the residential housing sector.\n\nFederal Agriculture Mortgage Corporation - provide credit for farm proprieties\n\nFederal Farm Credit System - provide credit for agricultural part of the economy\n\nStudent Loan Marketing Association (Sallie Mae) -provides support for higher education.\n\n\nGSEs issue two forms of debt: debentures are notes or bonds with typical maturities of one to 20 years, while discount notes are short-term papers with maturities ranging from overnight to 360 days.\n\nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac, as noted above, provide credit and support for the housing sector. In doing so, they issue securities that are backed by the mortgage loans that they purchase. \n\nThe loans act as collateral for the bonds and they come in three forms:\n\n\n Mortgage Pass through Securities: Mortgage pass through securities are created when one or more bondholders form a pool (or collection) of mortgages and sell shares or certificates in the  pool. The cash flows depend on the payments of the mortgage and opens the investor to prepayment risk. The monthly cash flows include net interest, scheduled principal payments and any principal prepayments.\n\nCollateralized Mortgage Obligations (CMOs): CMOs are a derivative securities. They help an investor pick the type of cash flows he wants to be exposed to based on how the pool of mortgages are sliced up into tranches. The tranches offer investors different payment rules and par values. For example Tranche A might receive all principal payments until the balance is zero then the payments would flow to Tranche B and so on.\n\nStripped Mortgage-Backed Securities: For CFA exam purposes, just know that the name exists in case they want three examples of Freddie or Fannie.\n\nMotivation Behind CMO Creation\nThe motivation behind creating a CMO is to spread the risk of prepayment among different classes of bonds. A CMO has several tranches that splits the mortgage pool into different layers. These layers have different par values and prepayment speeds. This aids investors in helping them manage the risk exposures they want in this arena.\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_298", "text": "\n\nThe Bankruptcy Process\nBankruptcy - this is the dirty little word that most debt holders hate to hear. It occurs when an entity can no longer make the payments to its creditors. Bankruptcy grants the entity protection from creditors. The entity can then decide whether to liquidate the company by selling everything and leaving no surviving entity or to have a reorganization. With a reorganization, a new entity will emerge after the bankruptcy. A bankruptcy can occur in two ways:\n\n\nVoluntary - the company decides to pull the plug by itself.\n\nInvoluntary\u0014 - the creditors decide to file for bankruptcy.\n\nThe rights of the bondholders are stronger than the equity holders of the firm. Bondholders get paid off before the equity holders in liquidation and they are first in line to receive new securities, cash or a mixture or both should a reorganization occur. Within the bondholder's group there is also a pecking order based on the seniority of each claim. Bondholders with more seniority, set forth in the indentures of the various classes of securities issued by the bankrupt firm, will receive their shares before the more junior holders. This is also known as the Absolute Priority Rule. This rule tends to hold up in courts for liquidations but not for reorganizations.\n\nDetermining Credit Rating\nA credit rating can be determined for a single issue or for an entire corporation. The rating can be affected by how senior or junior the issue is compared to the structure of the entity.\nThere are four main factors that rating agencies look at in developing their ratings:\n\n1. Character\nCharacter is a factor that is used to determined the quality of management in a corporation. Character includes: strategic direction, financial philosophy, whether or not they are conservative, track record, control systems and succession planning.\n\n2. Capacity\nCapacity describes a corporation's ability to pay its obligations. This factor includes: trends, regulatory environment, position in the industry, parent support and event risk.\n\n3. Collateral\nCollateral is the assets pledged to secure the debt. This also includes the unpledged assets of the firm.\n\n4. Covenants\nCovenants are the limitations or restrictions placed on the borrowers' activities. There are positive and negative covenants, both of which were  discussed earlier in the chapter.\n\nSecured Debt\nSecured debt is a type of corporate bond that has some form of collateral, which is pledged to ensure that there is payment of the debt. The collateral can be either real property or personal property the bondholder has a lien against in case of default. \n\r\nAnother form of secured debt is Collateral Trust Bonds. With these issues, a company may have no real assets and use stocks, bonds and other securities they own in other companies as the collateral. There tend to be limitations placed on how much a company can issue of this type of debt and this applies not only in the indenture but also through various tests. Such tests include issuance tests and earnings tests.\n\nUnsecured Debt\nUnsecured debt is known as a debenture bond. It is the same as a secured bond only it doesn't have the collateral pledge. The holders fall in the same range as general creditors if a default occurs. In case of default, secured debt is paid first, unsecured is paid second and if there is anything left, subordinated debenture bonds, or those held junior holders are finally paid.\n\nCredit Enhancements\nCredit enhancements are a way to reduce risk for the bondholders. This entails another company guaranteeing their loans, typical through a third-party guarantee. This helps finance special projects for the parent company, which may finance at higher rates but still uses the parent company to guarantee the debt to reduce those funding costs. \n\nLetters of Credit (LOC) are another form of enhancement. The LOC requires that the bank that issued the LOC make payments to the trustee when requested so that funds will be available for the issuer to make its payments. Even though this may reduce a layer of risk, the issuer and the firm that grants the LOC should be analyzed to ensure the bond is a solid investment.\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_299", "text": "\n\nCorporate Bonds vs. Medium-term Notes\nThe main difference between medium-term notes and corporate bonds is the way they are issued in the marketplace. MTNs can be offered to investors by the issuer's agent instead of being underwritten by investment banks and then sold to the public in one shot. \n\n\nThis helps to cover the funding gap between commercial paper and long-term bonds, hence the \"medium-term\" designation.\n\nWhen a firm what to issue this type of debt they have to file a \"shelf registration\" that lists the details of the offering, such as rates, maturities and the investment banks acting as their agent.\n\nIt is also important to know that MTNs can also come in different structures instead of mirroring a corporate bond. These include: step up notes, inverse floaters, deleveraged floaters, range notes and index amortizing notes.\n\nWhat is a Structured Note?\nA synthetic medium-term debt obligation with embedded components and characteristics that adjust the risk/return profile of the security. A structured note is a hybrid security that attempts to change its profile by including additional modifying structures. A simple example would be a 5 year bond tied together with an option contract for increasing the returns. A motivation for their issuance is the fact that they allow investors to realize a profit from favorable price movements.\n\nWhat is Commercial Paper?\nCommercial paper is a short term unsecured promissory note that is fewer than 270 days to maturity and is issued as a zero-coupon security. Companies continue to \"roll over\" or pay off the holders by issuing new commercial paper in the market. The risk to investors is that the issuing company will not be able to place the new commercial paper to pay off their older debt. \n\nCommercial Paper is issued in two ways:\n\n\nDirectly Placed: The issuing company sells the paper directly to the investing public without the help of an agent or intermediary. An example would include GE Capital.\n\nDealer-Placed: The issuing company uses an agent to help sell its paper in the marketplace.\n\nCommercial paper has its own credit rating and can de divided into financial and non-financial companies.\n\nBank Obligations\n\nNegotiable CDs - A savings certificate entitling the bearer to receive interest. A CD bears a maturity date, a specified fixed interest rate and can be issued in any denomination. CDs are generally issued by commercial banks and are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). The term of a CD generally ranges from one month to five years.\n\nA certificate of deposit is a promissory note issued by a bank. It is a time deposit that restricts holders from withdrawing funds on demand. Although it is still possible to withdraw the money, this action will often incur a penalty.\n\r\nFor example, let's say that you purchase a $10,000 CD with an interest rate of 5% compounded annually and a term of one year. At year's end, the CD will have grown to $10,500 ($10,000 * 1.05).\n\r\nCDs of less than $100,000 are called \"small CDs\"; CDs for more than $100,000 are called \"large CDs\" or \"jumbo CDs\". Almost all large CDs, as well as some small CDs, are negotiable.\n\nBankers Acceptances - A short-term credit investment created by a non-financial firm and guaranteed by a bank. Acceptances are traded at a discount from face value on the secondary market. Banker's acceptances are very similar to T-bills and are often used in money market funds.\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_300", "text": "\n\nAn asset-backed security is a security that is backed by a pool of loans or receivables. These include: auto loans, consumer loans, commercial assets (planes, receivables), credit cards, home equity loans, and manufactured housing loans. \n\nABSs are essentially the same thing as a mortgage-backed security except that the security is backs assets such as loans, leases, credit card debt, a company's receivables, royalties, etc and not mortgage based securities.\n\nSpecial Purpose Vehicles and Their Effect on Asset-backed Securities\nSPVs are also referred to as a \"bankruptcy-remote entity\" whose operations are limited to the acquisition and financing of specific assets. The SPV is usually a subsidiary company with an asset/liability structure and legal status that makes its obligations secure even if the parent company goes bankrupt.\n\nThanks to Enron, SPVs/SPEs are household words. These entities aren't all bad though. They were originally (and still are) used to isolate financial risk.\n\r\nA corporation can use such a vehicle to finance a large project without putting the entire firm at risk. Problem is, due to accounting loopholes, these vehicles became a way for CFOs to hide debt. Essentially, it looks like the company doesn't have a liability when they really do. As we saw with the Enron bankruptcy, if things go wrong, the results can be devastating.\n\nWhy Issue Asset-Backed Securities? \nThe primary motive for issuing asset-backed securities is to take an asset, such as a receivable, a loan or some other form of illiquid asset, and move it off the balance sheet. This helps the parent to clean up its balance sheet and monetize those receivables rather than waiting for the payments to come in. It can also help protect those assets in case the parent defaults. This is possible because the SPV that was created is a separate entity.\n\nTypes of Credit Enhancements\nCredit enhancement is designed to reduce risk. It comes in two forms:\n\n\nInternal Enhancements: Internal enhancements come in the form of reserve funds over collateralization and senior/subordinated structures. These will be covered in more detail in the CFA Level II exam.\n\nExternal Enhancements: External enhancements come in three forms of third-party guarantees. These include: corporate guarantee, letter of credit and bond insurance. The  enhancement can come from the parent company or from the newly created company that holds the assets. One problem with external enhancements is  that one not only has to analyze the assets and the company that owns them but also the company that is \"wrapping\" or insuring the debt. \n\nCollateralized Debt Obligations\nAn investment-grade security backed by a pool of bonds, loans and other assets. CDOs do not specialize in one type of debt but are often non-mortgage loans or bonds.\n\r\nSimilar in structure to a collateralized mortgage obligation (CMO) or collateralized bond obligation (CBO), CDOs are unique in that they represent different types of debt and credit risk. In the case of CDOs, these different types of debt are often referred to as 'tranches' or 'slices'. Each slice has a different maturity and risk associated with it. The higher the risk, the more the CDO pays.\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_301", "text": "\n\nThe U.S Federal Reserve (the Fed) has four tools it uses to directly influence short-term and, indirectly, long-term rate as well. They are:\n\n\nOpen Market Operations: The Fed buys Treasuries or adds funds to the system; this reduces short-term rates. The Fed also sells Treasuries or takes funds out of the system to increase short-term rates.\n\nThe Discount Rate: This is the rate at which banks can borrow on a collateralized basis at the Fed's discount window. If the Fed raises rates, they makes it more costly for  the banks to do business, which drains cash from the system. If the Fed eases this rate, banks will find it cheaper to borrow additional funds, which will add cash to the system.\n\nBank Reserve Requirements: This is hardly used these days. If the Fed raises these requirements, money is kept out of the economy. If they lower the rate, additional money will hit the economy.\n\nVerbal persuasion to influence how bankers supply credit to businesses and consumers: This simple method requires no additional explanation.\n\n\nWhat is a Yield Curve?\nA yield curve represents the relationship between maturity and yields. As an example:\n\n\n\n\n\n1 Month\n\n1.00%\n\n\n\n3 Month\n\n1.25%\n\n\n\n6 Month\n\n1.50%\n\n\n\n1 Year\n\n1.75%\n\n\n\n2 Year\n\n2.00%\n\n\n\n5 Year\n\n2.35%\n\n\n\n10 Year\n\n2.68%\n\n\n\n30 Year\n\n3.00%\n\n\n\n\nIf you were to graph this data you would see the yield curve develop. This date is only good for one single point in time because rates are constantly moving. If you are searching for a point on the yield curve that does not have a maturity represented by an actual \"on the run security\", that point will only be an approximation. \n\nYield Curve Shapes\nYield Curves come in three shapes:\n\n\nUpward or Normal Yield Curve: This curve occurs when short-term rates are lower than long-term rates, as  noted in the above example. \n\n\n\n\nInverted Yield Curve: This curve is formed when short-term rates are higher than the longer part of the curve.\n\n\n\n\nFlat Yield Curve: This curve occurs when there is little or no change between short-term and long-term rates.\n\n\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_302", "text": "\n\nThere are three main theories that try to describe the future yield curve:\n\n\nPure Expectation Theory: Pure expectation is the simplest and most direct of the three theories. The theory explains the yield curve in terms of expected short-term rates. It is  based on the idea that the two-year yield is equal to a one-year bond today plus the expected return on a one-year bond purchased one year from today. The one weakness of this theory is that it assumes that investors have no preference when it comes to different maturities and the risks associated with them. \n\nLiquidity Preference Theory: This theory states that investors want to be compensated for interest rate risk that is associated with long-term issues. Because of the longer maturity, there is a greater price volatility associated with these securities. The structure is determined by the future expectations of rates and the yield premium for interest-rate risk. Because interest-rate risk increases with maturity, the yield premium will also increase with maturity. Also know as the Biased Expectations Theory.\n\nMarket Segmentation Theory: This theory deals with the supply and demand in a certain maturity sector, which determines the interest rates for that sector. It can be used to explain just about every type of yield curve an investor can came across in the  market. An offshoot to this theory is that if an investor wants to go out of his  sector, he'll want to be compensated for taking on that additional risk. This is known as the Preferred Habitat Theory.\n\nImplications of the Yield Curve for the Yield-Curve Theories\n\n1. Pure Expectation Theory\nAccording to this theory, a rising term structure of rates means the market is expecting short-term rates to increase. So if the two-year rate is higher than the one-year rate, rates should rise. If the curve is flat, the market is expecting that short-term rates will remain low or hold constant in the future. A declining rate-term structure indicates the market believes that rates will continue to decline.\n\n2. Liquidity Preference Theory \nUnder this theory, the curve starts to get a little bit more bent. With an upward sloping yield curve, this theory really has no opinion as to where the yield curve is headed. It could continue to be upward sloping, flat, or declining, but the yield premium will increase fast enough to continue to produce an upward curve with no concerns about short-term interest rates. When it comes to a flat or declining term structure of rates, this suggests that rates will continue to decline in the short end of the curve given the theory's prediction that the yield premium will continue to increase with maturity.\n\n3. Market Segmentation Theory\nUnder this theory, any type of yield curve can occur, ranging from a positive slope to an inverted one, as well as a humped curve. A humped curve is where the yields in the middle of the curve are higher than the short and long ends of the curve. The future shape of the curve is going to be based on where the investors are most comfortable and not where the market expects yields to go in the future. \n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_303", "text": "\n\nfaEven though the way most investors discuss spreads is based on a Treasury security with the same maturity as the one it is being compared to, an investor can also talk about spreads between any two bonds with the following measures:\n\n1. Absolute Yield Spread\nThis is the way most spreads are measured in the market. This spread measures the difference in spread between two bonds in terms of basis points. \n\nThe equation is: Yield Spread = Yield on Bond A - Yield on Bond B\n\n2. Relative Yield Spread\nThis ratio measures the yield spread relative to the reference bond. \nThis equation is: Relative Yield Spread = Yield on bond A - Yield on Bond B/ Yield on Bond B\n\n3. Yield Ratio\nThis is just the ratio of the yields between the two bonds. \n\nThe equation is: Yield Ratio = Yield on Bond A / Yield on Bond B\n\nMarket convention is to use the on-the-run government security as the reference yield or bond. So in the above equations, one would replace Bond B with the comparable government security.\n\nExample: Yield Ratios\nWe want to compare an IBM five-year bond with a yield of 4.5 % and the on- the-run government five-year with a yield of 3.75%\n\nAnswer:\nAbsolute Yield Spread = 4.5% - 3.75% = .75% or 75 basis points\n\nRelative Yield Spread = 4.5% - 3.75% / 3.75% = .20 = 20%\n\nYield Ratio = 4.5% / 3.75% = 1.20\n\nWhy Relative Spreads Are Better\nInvestors may find relative spreads a better measure because they measure the magnitude of the yield spread and the way it is affected by interest-rate levels. While absolute spread may be maintained as rates change, relative spreads will move in or out depending on the level of rates.\n\nExample:\nUse the IBM and Treasury bond from the previous example, except now assume that yields have increased.\n\nAbsolute Yield Spread 5.75% - 5.00% = .75% or 75 basis points. Even though yields have increased the spread is the same. However, the Relative Spread has changed too:\n\nAnswer:\n5.75% - 5.00% / 5.00% = .15 or 15%.\n\nThis example shows that the relative spread can give an investor a better reading of how spreads are actually moving relative to the generic yield spread.\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_304", "text": "\n\nThe bond market is carved into different sectors based on the issuer.

Foreign Bonds\n\nThese sectors also can be broken down even further. For example, in the Corporate Sector, issuers can fall into one and sometimes more categories such as industrial, utilities, financials and bank.\r\nSpreads tend to be wider the farther one goes out the curve. Spreads can be based on individual sectors or crossed between them.\n\nIntermarket Sector Spreads \nIntermarket sector spreads deal with the yield spreads between two bonds in different sectors of the market. The most popular of these is a non-treasury security as opposed to a comparable treasury security. A comparable treasury security would be one with the same maturity.\n\nIntramarket Sector Spreads \nIntramarket sector spreads deal with the yield spread between two bonds in the same market sector. This can be done by developing a yield curve that is similar to the treasury yield curve but instead using the issuers' securities to develop the curve.\n\nSome other factors that affect spreads between bonds besides maturity are credit risk, any options that the bonds may have, the liquidity of the issuers and the tax bracket of investors who receive interest payments.\n\nCredit Spreads and Their Relationship to Economic Activity\nA Credit Spread is the yield spread between non-treasury and treasury securities. These are equal in all respects except their individual credit ratings. This means that their maturities are the same and that there are no options thrown into the equation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLook Out!\n\n\n\n\nIt is important to note that spreads increase with maturity and lower credit ratings.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpreads interact with economic growth or decline in two key ways: \n\n1. Spreads narrow or tighten - When the economy is growing, cash flows are increasing. Therefore, a corporation should have an easier time paying off its debt. Individuals will purchase more non-treasury securities than treasury securities because the increased economic activity reduces the default risk, causing spreads to tighten.\n\n2. Spreads widen - When economy is faltering or slowing down, spreads widen. When this happens, the possibility of defaults increases because cash flows are declining. Individuals will sell or dump non-treasury securities for government securities because there is less of a chance that the government will default on their debt when compared to a corporation. This is also known as a flight to safety.\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_305", "text": "\n\nFor options that benefit the issuer, such as calls, investors will want yield spreads that are greater than bonds and that do not have options embedded in them. Because there is a risk that the bonds will be called, investors want a higher yield to compensate for that risk, causing the spread to widen over the treasury security when compared to bonds without options. The longer the call period, the less spread widening investors will be needed because of a longer protection period against the call.\n\nOptions That Benefit the Holder\nFor options that benefit the holder, such as puts, investor will require a smaller yield spread than bonds that do not have embedded options in them, such as treasury bonds. There is even the possibility that the coupon rate could be lower than the treasury coupon rate, depending on how favorable the option is to the investors.\n\nSpreads and Liquidity\nWhen issues are less liquid, yield spreads tend to widen because there are fewer bonds to buy or it is harder to find a buyer. When issues are more liquid, such as on-the-run treasuries, yield spreads are tighter or narrower because there are plenty of buyers and sellers.\n\nThe larger the issue size, the more liquidity compared to a smaller issues in the market leads to tighter or narrower spreads and vice versa.\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_306", "text": "\n\nThe after-tax yield is the yield on a taxable bond after federal income taxes are paid.

If rates decline, a corporation may issue new bonds at a lower cost and call the older bonds. The same thing happens with MBSs and ABSs. As rates decline, borrowers have the right to refinance their loans at cheaper rates. This causes the bond to be paid off earlier than the stated maturity date.\n\nWhen rates increase, a puttable bond will be sold back to the issuing corporation at the put price once the increase in rates drives the price of the security below the put price.\n\nFor bonds in which the coupon payment rate is reset occasionally based on a formula with changing values, because the rate is always changing based on other variables it is hard to estimate the cash flows. Also, for bonds that give the investor the option to convert or exchange the security for common stock, the cash flows will stop altogether once the investor decides that it would be more profitable to exchange the fixed income security for equity. The investor will have no certain idea as to when this may occur, making it difficult to value the cash flows until the maturity of the bond.\n\nBecause the value of the bond rests on the performance of the securities that back the bond, it is hard to determine whether the bonds may be converted into those securities.\n\nDetermining Appropriate Interest Rates\nThe minimum interest rate that an investor should accept is the yield that is available in the market place for a risk-free bond, or the Treasury market for a U.S. investor. The Treasury security that is most often used is the on-the-run issues because they reflect the latest yields and are the most liquid securities.\n\nFor non-treasury bonds such as corporate bonds, the rate or yield that would be required would be the on-the-run government security plus a premium that takes up the additional risks that come with non-treasury bonds.\n\nAs for the maturity, an investor could just use the final maturity date of the issue compared to the Treasury security. However, because each cash flow is unique in its timing, it would be better to use the maturity that matches each of the individual cash flows.\n\nComputing a Bond's Value\nFirst of all, we need to find the present value (PV) of the future cash flows in order to value the bond. The present value is the amount that would be needed to be invested today to generate that future cash flow. PV is dependent on the timing of the cash flow and the interest rate used to calculate the present value. To figure out the value the PV of each individual cash flow must be found. Then, just add the figures together to determine the bonds price.\n\nFormula 14.7\n\n\n\n\n\nPV at time T = expected cash flows in period T / (1 + I) to the T power\n\n\n\n\nAfter you develop the expected cash flows, you will need to add the individual cash flows:\n\nFormula 14.8\n\n\n\n\n\nValue = present value @ T1 + present value @ T2 + present value @Tn\n\n\n\n\nLet's throw some numbers around to further illustrate this concept.\n\nExample: The Value of a Bond\nBond GHJ matures in five years with a coupon rate of 7% and a maturity value of $1,000. For simplicity's sake, the bond pays annually and the discount rate is 5%.\n\nAnswer:\nThe cash flow for each of the years is:\nYear one = $70 Year Two = $70 Year Three = $70, Year Four is $70 and Year Five is $1,070.\n\nPV of the cash flows is: Year one = 70 / (1.05) to the 1st power = $66.67\nYear two = 70 / (1.05) to the 2nd power = $ 63.49\nYear three = 70 / (1.05) to the 3rd power = $ 60.47\nYear four = 70 / (1.05) to the 4th power = $ 57.59\nYear five = 1070 / (1.05) to the 5th power = $ 838.37\n\nNow to find the value of the bond:\nValue = 66.67 + 63.49 + 60.47 + 57.59 + 838.37\nValue = 1, 086.59\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_310", "text": "\n\nHow Does the Value of a Bond Change?\nAs rates increase or decrease, the discount rate that is used also changes appropriately. Let's change the discount rate in the above example to 10% to see how it affects the value of the bond.\n\nExample: The Value of a Bond when Discount Rates Change\nPV of the cash flows is: Year one = 70 / (1.10) to the 1st power = $ 63.63\nYear two = 70 / (1.10) to the 2nd power = $ 57.85\nYear three = 70 / (1.10) to the 3rd power = $ 52.63\nYear four = 70 / (1.10) to the 4th power = $ 47.81\nYear five = 1070 / (1.10) to the 5th power = $ 664.60\n\nAnswer:\nValue = 63.63 + 57.85 + 52.63 + 47.81 + 664.60 = $ 886.52\n\n\nAs we can see from the above examples, an important property of PV is that for a given discount rate, the older a cash flow value is, the lower its present value. \n\nWe can also compute the change in value from an increase in the discount rate used in our example. The change = 1,086.59 - 886.52 = 200.07.\n\nAnother property of PV is that the higher the discount rate, the lower the value of a bond and the lower the discount rate the higher the value of the bond.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLook Out!\n\n\n\n\nIf the discount rate is higher than the coupon rate the PV will be less than par. If the discount rate is lower than the coupon rate, the PV will be higher than par value.\n\n\n\n\nHow Does a Bond's Price Change as it Approaches its Maturity Date?\nAs a bond moves closer to its maturity date, its price will move closer to par. The break down on the three scenarios is as follows:\n\n1. If a bond is at a premium, the price will decline over time towards its par value.\n2. If a bond is at a discount, the price will increase over time towards its par value\n3. If a bond is at par, its price will remain the same.\n\nTo show how this works lets use our original example of the 7% bond, but now let's assume a year has passed and a discount rate remains the same at 5%.\n\nExample: Price Changes Over Time\nLet's compute the new value to see how the price moves closer to par. You should also be able to see how the amount by which the bond price changes is attributed to it being closer to it's maturity date.\n\nPV of the cash flows is: Year one = 70 / (1.05) to the 1st power = $66.67\nYear two = 70 / (1.05) to the 2nd power = $ 63.49\nYear three = 70 / (1.05) to the 3rd power = $ 60.47\nYear four = 1070 / (1.05) to the 4th power = $880.29\n\nAnswer:\nValue = 66.67 + 63.49 + 60.47 + 880.29 = 1,070.92\n\nAs the price of the bond decreases, it moves closer to its par value. Theamount of change attributed to the year's difference is 15.67.\n\nAn individual can also decompose the change that results when a bond approaches its maturity date and the discount rate changes. This is accomplished by first taking the net change in the price that reflects the change in maturity, and then adding it to the change in the discount rate. The two figures should equal the overall change in the bond's price.\n\nComputing the Value of a Zero-coupon Bond\nThis may be the easiest of securities to value because there is only one cash flow - the maturity value. \n\nValue of a zero coupon bond that matures N years from now is:\n\nFormula 14.9\n\n\n\n\n\nZero coupon bond value = Maturity value / (1 + I) to the power of the number of years x 2\nWhere I is the semi-annual discount rate.\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: The Value of a Zero-Coupon Bond\nFor illustration purposes, let's look at a zero coupon with a maturity of three  years and a maturity value of $1,000 discounted at 7%\n\nAnswer:\nI = 0.035 (.07 / 2)\nN = 3\n\nValue of a Zero = 1,000 / (1.035) to the 6th power (3 x 2)\n= 1,000 / 1.229255\n= 813.50\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_311", "text": "\nUnder a traditional approach to valuing a bond, it is typical to view the security as a single package of cash flows, discounting the entire issue with one discount rate. Under the arbitrage-free valuation approach, the issue is viewed, instead, as various zero-coupon bonds that should be valued individually and added together to determine value. The reason this is the correct way to value a bond is that it does not allow a risk-free profit to be generated by \"stripping\" the security and selling the parts at a higher price than purchasing the security in the market. \nAs an example, a five-year bond that pays semi-annual interest would have 11 separate cash flows, and be valued using the appropriate yield on the curve that matches its maturity. So the markets implement this approach by determining the theoretical rate the U.S. Treasury would have to pay on a zero-coupon treasury for each maturity. The investor then determines the value of all the different payments using the theoretical rate and adds them together. This zero-coupon rate is the treasury spot rate. The value of the bond based on the spot rates is the arbitrage-free value. \nDetermining Whether a Bond is Under or Over Valued \nWhat you need to be able to do is value a bond like we have done before using the more traditional method of applying one discount rate to the security. The twist here, however, is that instead of using one rate, you will use whatever rate the spot curve has that coordinates with the proper maturity. You will then add the values up as you did previously to get the value of the bond. You will then be given a market price to compare to the value that you derived from your work. If the market price is above your figure, then the bond is overvalued and you should sell the issue. If the market price is below your price, then the bond is undervalued and you should buy the issue.\nHow Does a Dealer Generate Arbitrage Profits? \nA dealer has the ability to strip a security or to take apart the cash flows that make up the bond. These Treasury strips can be sold to investors. So if the market price of a Treasury security is less than the value using the arbitrage-free valuation, a dealer will buy the security, strip the bond and then sell the Treasury strips at a higher amount than the purchase price for the whole bond.\nOn the other hand, if the market price is more than the value using the arbitrage-free valuation, the dealer will buy the strips, make the bond \"whole\" and sell it at a higher price than that of the purchased strips.\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_312", "text": "\n\nThere are three sources of return an investor can expect to receive by investing in bonds:\n\n1. The coupon payment made by the issuer.\n2. Any capital gain or loss (negative dollar return) when the bond matures, is called or is sold. This is the difference between the purchase price and the price when the bond is no longer owned by you.\n3. Income from the reinvestment of interim cash flows such as interest payments and any prepayments of principal prior to the final or stated maturity date. You take the interim payment and invest it in another fixed income security to earn additional returns. This is also known as interest on interest.\n\nThis section is all about formulas and bond math; some of the questions you see on your CFA Level 1 exam will almost certainly come out of this section.\n\n1. Current Yield\nCurrent yield relates the annual dollar coupon interest to the bond's market price:\n\nFormula 14.10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Yield = annual dollar coupon interest / price\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Current Yield \nIBM ten-year bond with a rate of 5% and market price of 98.\n\nAnswer:\nStep1 - Figure out the annual dollar coupon interest= .05 x $100 = 5$\n\nCurrent Yield = $5 / 98 = .05102= 5.1%\n\nCurrent yield is greater when bond is selling at a discount. The opposite is true for a premium bond. If a bond is selling at par, the current yield will equal the coupon rate. \n\nThe drawback using current yield is that it only considers the coupon  interest and nothing else.\n\n2. Yield to Maturity (YTM)\nYield to maturity is the most popular measure of yield in the market. It isthe rate that will make the present value of a bond's cash flows equal toits market price plus accrued interest. To find YTM, one has to develop the cash flows and then, through trial and error, find the interest rate thatmakes the present value of cash flow equal to the market price plus accrued interest. \n\nThis is basically a special type of internal rate of return (IRR).\n\nExample: Yield to Maturity\nAn example using the above IBM bond the cash flows will consist of 20 payments of $2.50 every six months and a payment, twenty six-month periods from now, of $100. The present values, using various semi-annual discounts, are as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSemi-annual interest Rate\u00a0\n\nPresent Value\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t2.50%\n\r\n\t\t\t\t100\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t2.60%\n\r\n\t\t\t\t99.5\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t2.70%\n\r\n\t\t\t\t99\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t2.80%\n\r\n\t\t\t\t98.5\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t2.90%\n\r\n\t\t\t\t98\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the rate of 2.9% is used the present value of the cash flows is equal to a price of $98.00. Hence the semi-annual yield to maturity is 2.9%. Now that we have found this we must make it into a market convention rate or the bond-equivalent yield. To get this yield, just double the semi-annual rate. In this example, it would be 5.8% yield to maturity. \n\nBond Price, Coupon Rate, Current Yield and Yield to Maturity\n\n\nFor a bond selling at par: \nCoupon Rate = Current Yield = Yield to Maturity\n\nFor a bond selling at a discount:\nCoupon Rate < Current Yield < Yield to Maturity\n\nFor a bond selling at a premium:\nCoupon Rate > Current Yield > Yield to Maturity\n\n\nThe limitations of the yield to maturity measure are that it assumes that thecoupon rate will be reinvested at an interest rate equal to the YTM. Besides  that it does take into considerationthe coupon income and capital gains orloss as well as the timing of the cash flows.\n\n3. Yield to First Call\nYield to first call is computed for a callable bond that is not currently callable. The actual calculation is the same as the Yield to Maturity with the only difference being that instead of using a par value and the stated maturity, the analyst will use the call price and the first call date in calculating the yield.\n\n4. Yield to First Par Call\nAgain, yield to first par call is the same procedure as above, with the difference being that the maturity date that will be used instead of the stated maturity date is the first time the issuer can call the bonds at par value.\n\n5. Yield to Refunding\nYield to refunding is used when the bonds are currently callable but there are certain restrictions on the source of funds used to buy back the debt   when a call is exercised. The refunding date is the first date the bond can be called using a lower-cost debt. The calculation is the same as YTM.\n\n6. Yield to Put\nYield to put is the yield to the first put date. It is calculated the same way as YTM but instead of the stated maturity of the bond, one uses the first put date.\n\n7. Yield to Worst\nYield to worst is the yield occurs when one calculates every possible call and put date that has the lowest possible yield. For example if you calculate all the call dates and the yield comes out as follows 5.6%, 7.6%, 8.2% and 7.5%, the yield to worst would be 5.6%. This measure means little to the potential return; it is supposed to measures the worst possible return the investor will receive if the bond is called or put.\n\n8. Cash Flow Yield\nCash flow yield deals with mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities. The cash flows of these securities are interest and principal payments. What makes this complicated is that the borrowers who make up the mortgage or asset pool can prepay their loans in whole or in part prior to the scheduled principal payment. Because of this, the cash flows have to be estimated and an assumption must be made as to when these principle prepayments may occur. The rate that exists when the prepayments occurs is called the prepayment rate or prepayment speed.Once this rate is estimated, a yield can be calculated. The yield is the interest rate that will make the present value of the estimated cash flows equal the price plus accrued interest.\n\nExample: Cash Flow Yield\nBecause cash flows for these securities are usually monthly, a bond-equivalent yield must be developed. The math here is a little different than in the above examples:\n\nStep 1 - the effective semi-annual yield must be computed from the monthly yield by compounding it for six months.\n\nEffective semi-annual yield = (1 + monthly yield) to the 6th power -1\n\nStep 2 - Double the effective semi-annual yield to get the annual cash flow on a bond equivalent basis.\n\nCash flow yield = 2 x {(1 + monthly yield) to the sixth power-1}\n\nAnswer:\nSo if the monthly yield is .8% then: \n\nCash flow yield = 2*{ 1.008) to the sixth power -1}\n= 2 x .04897\n= 9.79%\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_313", "text": "\n\nThe main underlying assumptions used concerning the traditional yield measures are:\n\n1. The bond will be held to maturity.\n2. Coupons can be reinvested at the yield to maturity\n\nLimitations:\n1. Current yield- Current yield only considers the coupon interest and no other sources for an investors return. It does not take into consideration the capital gain when a bond is purchased at a discount or the capital loss when the bond is purchased at a premium. Also, reinvestment income is not taken into consideration.\n\n2. Yield to Maturity - Yield to maturity measures assume that the coupon payments will be reinvested at the coupon rate\n\n3. Yield to Call - Yield to call assumes investor will hold the bond to the assumed call price and that the issuer will call the bond on that date which both are unrealistic. Also, the comparison of different yields to call with the YTM are meaningless because the cash flows stop once the issuer calls the bond.\n\n4. Yield to Put - This assumes that coupon payments will be reinvested at the calculated yield and that the bonds will be put on the first date.\n\n5. Yield to Worst - This measure does not identify the potential return over some time horizon and fails to take into account that the calculation for a YTW has different exposures to reinvestment risk.\n\n6. Cash Flow Yield - Cash flow yield assumes that the coupons will be reinvested at the coupon rate and that the bond will be held to maturity. However, because cash flow yield tend to be used for MBSs or ABSs there is a risk that the bonds will be prepaid and the measure of cash flow yield will be thrown out the window.\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_314", "text": "\n\nReinvestment income can make up a large portion of the return for a bond. Before beginning with calculations, it is important to understand the difference between total future dollars, which is equal to all the dollars an investor expects to receive and the total dollar return, which is equal to the dollars the investor will realize from the three sources of income for a bond (coupon payment, capital gain/loss, and reinvestment income)\nExample: Reinvestment Income\nLet's look at an investor that has $96 to invest in a certificate of deposit (CD) that will mature in five years. The bank will pay 3% every six months, which equals a bond equivalent basis of 6%. The total future value of this investment today would be:\nAnswer:\n96 x (1.03) to the tenth power = $129.02\nSo the investment of $96 for five years at 6% on a BEY will generate $129.02\nTo further break it down:\nTotal Future Dollars = 129.02\nReturn of Principal = 96.00\nTotal interest = 33.02\nNow let's turn to a bond that has a price of $96, five-year maturity and with a coupon of 5% and YTM of 6%. As shown above an investor must generate $129.02 to provide a yield of 6% or the total dollar return must be $33.02.\nSo with this bond, the sources of return are a capital gain of: $4 ($100 - $96) and coupon interest of $2.50 for ten periods or $25. That equals $29 without the reinvestment of the coupon payments. As we can see, this leads to a shortfall of $4.02 when compared to the CD example above. This $4.02 can be generated if the coupon payments are invested at a 3% semi-annual rate at the time it is paid.\nFor the first payment the reinvestment income earned is:\n$2.50 x (1.03) to 10 - 1 power - 2.50 = $2.50 x (1.03) to 9th power = $0.76.\nIf you were to continue this effort, which is unlikely to be required on the exam, you would find the reinvestment income would equal $4.02.\nTo continue this with the three sources of income would produce the following:\nCapital Gain of $4\nCoupon Interest of $25\nReinvestment Income or $4.02\nThe total would be $33.02.\nTherefore, reinvestment income accounts for 12% of the total return, illustrating how important reinvestment income can be for an investor.\nFactors That Affect Reinvestment Risk\nThere are two characteristics that affect reinvestment risk:\n1. For a given yield to maturity and a given non-zero coupon rate, the longer the maturity, the more the bond's total return depends on reinvestment revenue to realize the yield to maturity at purchase time. Longer maturity = greater reinvestment risk.\n2. For a given coupon-paying bond with a given maturity and yield to maturity, the higher the coupon rate, the more the total dollar return depends on the reinvestment of the coupon payments. This must occur in order to produce the yield to maturity at the time of purchase.\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_315", "text": "\n\nOn some occasions, such as with non-U.S. government bonds which pay annual interest compared to semi-annual interest in the U.S., an adjustment needs to be made in order to compare their yields. \nThe computation is as follows:\n\nFormula 14.11\n\n\n\n\nBond-equivalent yield of an annual-pay bond = 2[(1 + yield on annual-pay bond) to the .5 power - 1]\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: \nAssume that the YTM on an annual-pay bond is 8%.\n\nAnswer:\nBond-equivalent yield = 2 [(1 + .08) to the .5 power - 1]\n= 2 [.03923]\n= .078461 = 7.95%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLook Out!\n\n\n\n\nThe bond equivalent yield will always be less than the annual-yield.\n\n\n\nExample:\nNow if you want to convert the bond equivalent yield of a U.S. bond into an annual-pay bond the calculations are as follows:\n\nFormula 14.12\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYield on annual-pay basis = [(1 + yield on bond-equivalent basis/2)2-1 \n\n\n\n\nExample:\nThe yield of a U.S. bond quoted on a bond-equivalent basis of 8%: \n\nAnswer:\nYield on annual-pay basis = [(1 + 8/2 to the 2nd power) -1]\n= [(1.04) to the 2nd power - 1]\n= .0816 = 8.16%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLook Out!\n\n\n\n\nThe yield on an annual-pay basis is always greater than the yield on a bond-equivalent basis.

We have a six month annualized yield of 4% and similarly of the 1 year Treasury Security the rate is 4.40%. Given these two rates we can compute the 1.5 year theoretical spot rate of a zero coupon bond.

For example, if an IBM is trading at a YTM or 6.25% and the comparable Treasury is at 5%, then the nominal spread is 125 basis points. This spread measure takes into consideration the extra credit risk, option risk and any liquidity risk that may be associated with the non-treasury security.\n\nEven though this is a quick and dirty way to describe the yield difference, it has two drawbacks. They are:\n\n1. For bond bonds, the yield does not take into consideration the term structure of spot rates.\n2. In the case of callable/puttable bonds, expected interest-rate volatility may change the cash flows of the non-treasury security.\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_316", "text": "\n\nThe nominal spread is simply the difference in basis points between the Treasury and non-treasury security. For example, if the Stone & Co. bonds have a yield of 5.5% and the comparable Treasury security has a yield of 4.5% the nominal spread is 100 bps. (5.5% - 4.5%).\n\n\nZero-Volatility Spread or Z-spread \nThis measures the spread the investor would capture over the entire Treasury spot- rate curve if the bond was held to maturity. The Z-spread is calculated  as the spread that will make the present value of cash flows from the non-treasury security when they are discounted at the Treasury spot rates plus the Z-spread equal to the non-Treasury securities price. This is done by trial and error. This is different than the nominal spread because the nominal spread just uses one point on the curve.\n\nFor example, take the spot curve and add 50 basis points to each rate on the curve. If the two year spot rate is 3%, the rate you would use to find the present value of that cash flow would be 3.50%. After you have calculated all of the present values for the cash flows, add them up and see whether they equal the bonds price. If they do, then you have found the Z-spread, if not, you have to go back to the drawing board and use a new spread until the present value of those cash flows equals the bonds price.\n\n\n\nOption-Adjusted Spread (OAS) \nThis takes the dollar difference between the fair price and the market price and converts it into a yield measure. The OAS helps reconcile the value to market price by finding a spread that will equate the two. This is also done on a trial-and-error basis and is very model dependent.\nRemember: \n\n\n\nInterest rate volatility is critical. The higher the volatility, the lower the OAS. Check this assumption when making comparisons.\n\nThe OAS is a spread over the Treasury spot-rate curve or benchmark that is used in the analysis.\n\nAs the name implies, the security's embedded option can change the cash flows and the value of the security should take this change in account. The difference between the OAS And the Z-spread is that the Z-spread doesn't take this into consideration.\n\n\n\nOption Cost\nThis cost can be derived by calculating the difference between the OAS at the assumed interest rate or yield volatile and the Z-spread.\nZ-spread = OAS + option cost\nTherefore,\nOption Cost = Z-spread - OAS\nThe option cost is measured in this way because if rates do not change, the investor would earn the Z-spread. When future rates are uncertain, the speed tends to be different because of the embedded option. The option cost for a callable bond and most MBS and ABS securities are positive. This is because the issuer's ability to alter the bond's cash flows will result in an OAS that is less than the Z-spread. For puttable bonds the option cost is negative because of the investor's ability to alter the cash flows.\n\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_317", "text": "\n\nForward rates can be defined as the way the market is feeling about the future movements of interest rates. They do this by extrapolating from the risk-free theoretical spot rate. For example, it is possible to calculate the one-year forward rate one year from now. Forward rates are also known as implied forward rates.\nTo compute a bond's value using forward rates, you must first calculate this rate. After you have calculated this value, you just plug it into the formula for the prices of a bond where the interest rate or yield would be inserted.\n\nExample:\nAn investor can purchase a one-year Treasury bill or buy a six-month bill and roll it into another six-month bill once it matures. The investor will be  indifferent if they both produce the same result. An investor will know the spot rate for the six-month bill and the one-year bond, but he or she will not know the value of a six-month bill that is purchased six months from now. Given these two rates though, the forward rate on a six-month bill will be the  rate that equalizes the dollar return between the two types of investments mentioned earlier.\n\nAnswer:\nAn investor buys a six-month bill for $x. At the end of six months, the value would equal:\n\nx(1 + z1) \nwhere z1 = one half of the bond equivalent yield on the six month spot rate.\n\nF= one half the forward rate (expressed as a BEY) of a six-month rate six months from now. If he bought the six-month bill and reinvested the proceeds for another six months the dollar return would be calculated like this:\n\nX(1 +z1) (1 + F)\n\nFor the one year investment the future dollars would be x(1 +z)2\n\nSo F = (1 + z2)2/ (1 + z1) - 1\n\nThen double F to get the BEY.\n\nHere are some numbers to try in this formula:\nSix-month spot rate is 0.05 = 0.025 = z1\n1-year spot rate is 0.055 = 0.0275= z2\n\nF = ( 1.0275)2/ (1.025) -1\nF = .030 or .06 or 6% BEY\n\nTo confirm this:\nX(1.025)(1.03) = 1.05575\nX(1.02575)2 = 1.05575\n\nOnce you have developed the future rate curve, you can continue to run and gun in the basic bond equation using the forward rates instead of the discount rate to value the bond.\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_318", "text": "\nLet's say an investor buys a two-year zero-coupon bond.

In this case, the value would be:\nX (1 + z1)(1 + future rate at time 2)(1+ future rate at time 3) (1 + future rate at time 4)\nBecause these two investments must be equal this tells us that:\nX (1 + z4)4 = X (1 + z1)(1 + future rate at time 2)(1+ future rate at time 3)(1 + future rate at time 4)\nSo Z4 = [(1 + z1)(1 + future rate at time 2)(1+ future rate at time 3)(1 + future rate at time 4)]\u00bc - 1\nThis equation states that the two-year spot rate depends on the current six-month rate and the following three six-month spot rates.\nAs we can see, short-term forward rates must equal spot rates or else an arbitrage opportunity can exist in the market place.\nCompute Spot Rates if Given Forward Rates, and Forward Rates if Given Spot Rates\nComputing a forward rate by using spot rates is covered above. Using spot rates, an investor can develop any forward rate.\nThere are two elements to the forward rate. The first is when the future rate begins. The second is the length of time for that rate. The notation is length of time of the forward rate f when the forward rate began. For example, a 2 f 8 would be the 1-year (two six-month periods) forward rate beginning four years (eight six-month periods) from now.\nTo solve for tFm use the following equation:\nFormula 15.13\n\u00a0\n\ntFm =[ (1 + Zm+t)m+t / (1 + Zm)m] 1/t - 1 \n\nSo for a 3f5 it would equal an equation of: [(1 + z8)8/ (1 + z5)5]1/3 -1\nExample:\nZ3(the 1.5 year spot rate) = 3.5%/2 = .0175\nZ5 (the 2.5 year spot rate) = 4.25%/2 = .02125\nAnswer:\nSo 3f5 =[(1.02125)/ (1.0175)5]1/3 -1\nS3f5 = .027916\nDoubling this rate gives you a rate of 5.58%\n\u00a0\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_319", "text": "\n\nThe Full Valuation Approach\nThe full valuation approach to measuring the interest rate risk is to re-value the bond or portfolio for a given interest-rate change scenario. This rate change can be parallel or non-parallel. It is also referred to as a scenario analysis because it involves the way in which your exposure will change as a result of certain interest rate scenarios. For example, an investor may evaluate the portfolio based on an increase in rates of 50, 100 and 200 basis points. Each bond is valued and then the total value of the portfolio is computed under the various scenarios.\n\nThe Duration/Convexity Approach\nIn contrast, the duration/convexity approach just looks at one time parallel move in interest rates using the properties of price volatility.\n\nBecause the full valuation approach uses various outcomes to measure the risk of the bond or portfolio, as compared to a one time move for the duration/convexity approach, it bears that the full valuation approach is better suited to measuring interest-rate risk even though it can be very time consuming.\n\nExample: Compute the Interest-Rate Risk Exposure\nLet's take an option-free bond with an 8% coupon, ten-year bond with a price of 125. Yield to maturity is 7% \n\nAnswer:\nScenario 1 is an increase of 50bps that drives the price down to 120 (this is just an estimate). To see the percentage change you take the new price after the yield change and subtract it from the initial price after the change divided by the initial price.\n\n120 - 125 / 125 = -.04 = a 4 % decrease in the price of the bond due to a 50 bps change\n\nScenario 2 is an increase of 100 bps that drives the price down to 114.\n\n114 - 125 / 125 = - .088 = an 8.8% decrease in price due to a 100 bps change.\n\nYou can use this for any type of scenario concerning a change in yields.\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_320", "text": "\n\nPrice Volatility for Option-free Bonds\nThe fundamental change in price is that which causes yields to increase as price decreases and vice versa. This relationship is not linear, however, it is convex. \n\nThere are four properties concerning the price volatility of an option free bond:\n1. Price moves in the opposite direction of a change in yields, but the percentage change is not the same for all bonds.\n2. For small changes in yields, the percentage change is roughly the same no matter what direction rates move.\n3. For large changes in yields, the percentage price change is not the same for an increase in yield as it is for a decrease in yield\n4. For a given large change in yield, the percentage price increase is greater than the percentage price decrease.\n\nAlthough the above properties apply to percentage change they still apply to dollar changes.\n\nProperties three and four involve the convex shape of the price yield relationship. Property four states that with a long a bond, the price increase when rates decline will be greater than the price decrease when rates rise.\n\nPositive Convexity \nPositive convexity is what market participants refer to the yield/price relationship of option free bonds.\n\nPrice-Volatility Characteristics of Callable and Prepayable Securities\nThe price of a callable bond will react in the same way as an option-free bond when market rates are high. This is because there is less of a chance of the bonds being called by the issuer because they probably will not be able to refinance the bonds at a lower interest rate. When rates decline, on the other hand, the price increase of a callable bond will be held to that call price because of the increased chance of the bonds being called by the issuer. Meanwhile, option-free bonds will continue to see an increase in price as rates fall. Would you pay $105, for example, for a bond that could be called at $101 as rates drop? In essence, you give $4 dollars away. It is for this same reason that bonds are unlikely to be called by issuer when the rates are low.\n\nThese bonds contain negative convexity. That is, the price appreciation is less than its price decline when rates change by a large amount. The bonds will not always exhibit negative convexity; at higher rates they will exhibit positive convexity just like an option-free bond.\n\nPrice Volatility Characteristics of Putable Bonds\nA bondholder can redeem puttable bonds on certain dates and at certain prices. The advantage of these bonds to an investor is that if market yields rise and the value of the bond falls below the put price, the investor can exercise the put option and stem his losses to the put price. This can not be done with an option-free bond. \n\nValue of puttable bond = value of option free bond + the option. \n\nThe price of a puttable bond will react same way as an option-free bond at low yield levels. As rates rise, the puttable bond's price will decrease at the same rate as an option-free bond, but the decline will be lessened because of the value of the put option.\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_321", "text": "\n\nEffective Duration\r\nDuration is the approximate percentage change in price for a 100 basis point change in rates. To compute duration, you can apply the following equation that was presented earlier in the guide.\n\nPrice if yield decline - price if yield rise / 2(initial price)(change in yield in decimal)\n\nLet's make:\r\n\u2206y = change in yield in decimal (\u2206 = \"delta\")\nV1 = initial price\nV2 = price if yields decline by \u2206y\nV3 = price if yields increase by \u2206y\n\nDuration = V2 - V3 / 2(V1)(? y)\n\nExample: \nStone & Co 9% of 10 are option free and selling at 106 to yield 8.5%. Let's change rates by 50 bps. The new price for the increase in 50 bps would be 104 and the new price for a decrease in rates would be 109. Then: \n\nAnswer:\nDuration = 109 - 104 / 2 *(106) * (.005)\nDuration = 5 / 1.06\nDuration = 4.717\n\nThis means that for a 100 basis point change, the approximate change would be 4.717%\n\nPrice Change Given the Effective Duration and Change in Yield \nOnce you have computed the effective duration of a bond it is easy to find the approximate price change given at change in yield.\n\nFormula 14.13\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApproximate Percent Price change = - duration x change in yield x 100\n\n\n\n\n\nExample:\nUsing the duration for 4.717% obtained from the previous example, let's see the approximate change for a small movement in rates such as a 20 bps increase.\n\nPercentage Price Change = - 4.717 x (+0.0020) x 100 = -.943%\nAnd for a large change, a 250 bps increase:\n\nPercentage Price Change = -4.717. (+0.0250) x 100 = -11.79%\n\nAs noted before, these changes are estimates. For small changes in rates, the estimate will be almost dead on. For larger movements in rates, the estimate will be close but will underestimate the new price of the bond regardless of whether the movement in rates is up or down.\n\nModified Duration\nModified duration is the approximate percentage change in a bond's price for a 100 basis points change in yield, assuming that the bond's expected cash flow does not change when the yield changes. This works for option-free bonds such as Treasuries but not with option-embedded bonds because the cash flows may change due to a call or prepayment.\n\nEffective Duration \nEffective duration takes into account the way in which changes in yield will affect the expected cash flows. It takes into account both the discounting that occurs at different interest rates as well as changes in cash flows. This is a more appropriate measure for any bond with an option embedded in it.\n\nMacaulay Duration\nIn order to better understand Macaulay duration, let's first turn to the modified duration equation:\n\nFormula 14.14\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmodified duration = 1/(1+yield/k)[1 x pvcf1 + 2\u00a0 x pvcf2 +...+n x pvcfn / k x Price \n\n\n\n\nWhere:\nk = the number of periods: two for semi-annual, 12 for monthly and so on.\nn = the number of periods to maturity\nyield = YTM of the bond\npvcf = the present value of cash flows discounted at the yield to maturity.\n\nThe bracket part of the equation was developed by Frederick Macaulay in 1938 and is referred to as Macaulay Duration.\n\nSo Modified duration = Macaulay's Duration/ (1 + yield/k)\n\nMacaulay's duration gives the analysis a short cut to measure modified duration. But because modified duration is flawed by not incorporating the change in cash flows due to an embedded option, so are Macaulay durations.\n\nWhen is Effective Duration a Better Measure?\nWhen a bond has an embedded option, the cash flows can change when interest rates change because of prepayments and the exercise of calls and puts. Effective duration takes into consideration the changes in cash flows and values that can occur from these embedded options.\n\nWhy is duration the best interpretation of a measure of the sensitivity of a bond or portfolio to changing interest rates?\nAs expressed throughout this guide, duration gives an approximate percentage change for a 100 basis point change in rates. Once you understand duration, it is a quick way to calculate the change in a bond's value. It also allows an investor to get a \"feel\" for the price change. For example, you can tell a client that the duration of measure of 7 for their portfolio would equal roughly a 7% change in their portfolio's value if rates change, plus or minus 100 basis points. It also allows a manager or investor a way to compare bonds regarding the interest rate risk under certain assumptions.\n\nA portfolio's duration is equal to the weighted average of the durations of the bonds in the portfolio. The weight is proportional to how much of the portfolio consists of a certain bond.\n\nFormula 14.15\n\n\n\n\n\nPortfolio Duration = w1D1 + w2D2 ...+ wkDk\n\n\n\n\n\nExample:\nLet's take 3 bonds:\n\n$6,000,000 market value of Stone & Co 7% of 10 with duration of 5.5\n$3,400,000 market value of Zack Stores 5% or 15 with duration of 7.8\n$1,535,000 market value of Yankee Corp. 9% or 20 with duration of 12\n\nTotal market valve of $10,935,000\n\nAnswer:\nFirst let's find the weighted average of each bond\nStone & Co. weighted average is 6,000,000 / 10,935,000 = .548\nZack Stores weighted average is 3,400,000 / 10,935,000 = .311\nYankee Corp. weighted average is 1,535,000 / 10935,000 = .14\n\nSo the portfolio duration = .548(5.5) + .311(7.8) + .14 (12) \n= 7.119\n\nThis means that if rates change by 100 bps the portfolio's value will change by approximately by 7.119%. Keep in mind that the individual bonds will not change by this much because each will have their own duration.\n\nYou can also use this to figure out the dollar amount of the change. This is done by using the dollar duration equation and adding up the change for all of the bonds in the portfolio.\n\nGoing back to our example of those three bonds and a 50 bps yield change.\n\nPercentage price change = -duration x change in yield x market value\nStone & Co = -5.5 x .005 x 6,000,000 = 165,000\nZack Stores = -7.8 x .005 x 3,400,000 = 132,600\nYankee Corp = -12 x .005 x 1,535,000 = 92,100\n\nSo the dollar change for a 50 bp change would be equal to approximately $389,700\n\nLimitations of the Portfolio Duration Measure\nThe primary limitation of this measure is that each of the bonds in the portfolio must change by the 100 or 50bps, or there must be a parallel shift in the yield curve for the duration measure to be useful.\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_322", "text": "\n\nConvexity helps to approximate the change in price that is not explained by duration. If you go back to the third property of a bond's price volatility you will see that when there is a large change in rates, the duration measure can be way off because of the convex nature of the yield curve. \n\nTo calculate convexity the formula is:\n\nFormula 14.16\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConvexity adjustment to the percentage price change = C x change in yield squared x 100\n\n\n\n\nTo find the C in the equation, use this equation that has the same notation as duration:\n\nC = V3 +V2 - 2(V1) / 2V1(change in yield) squared \n\nEstimate a Bond's Price Given Duration, Convexity and Change in Yield \nThis is done by simply adding the convexity adjustment and the percentage price change due to duration equations to achieve an estimate that is closer than just a duration measure.\n\nFormula 14.17\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal Price change = (-duration x change in yield x 100) + (C x change in yield squared x 100)\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Total Price Change\nUsing the Stone & Co. bonds that had duration of 5.5, let's add a convexity of 93 and an increase of 150 bps in yield.\n\nAnswer: Price Increase\nTotal Price Change = (-5.5 x .0150 x 100) + (93 x .0150 squared x 100)\n= -8.25 + 2.0925\n= 6.157 \nSo if rates increase by 150 bps, the price will decrease by 6.157%\n\nNow let's look at a decrease of 150 bps in yield.\n\nAnswer: Price Decrease\n\nTotal Price Change = (-5.5 x -.0150 x 100) + (93 x -.0150 squared x 100)\n= 8.25 + 2.0925\n= 10.34\n\nSo if rates decrease by 150 bps, the price will increase by 10.34 %\n\nAgain, if you refer to the properties of price volatility, you can see that as rates decrease, the price increase will be greater than the decrease in price when rates rise.\n\nModified Convexity vs. Effective Convexity \nWith modified convexity the cash flows do not change due to a change in interest rates.\n\nEffective Convexity, on the other hand, assumes that cash flow does change due to a change in interest rates.\n\nWhen bonds have options, it is best to use effective convexity just like you should use effective duration. For option-free bonds, either convexity measure will be a positive value, whereas when it comes to bonds with options, the effective convexity could be negative even if the modified convexity is positive.\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_323", "text": "\n\nThis measure is the absolute value of the change in price of a bond for a one basis point change in yield. It is another way to measure interest-rate risk.

Instead of using a 100 basis point change you are simply using a 1 basis point  change.\n\nAn example using the Stone & Co. bonds with duration of 5.5\n\n5.5 x 0.0001 x 100 = .055% change\n\nIf the price was 98 the dollar price change would be:\n\n.055% x 98 = $ 0.53 \n\nConclusion\nCongratulations!

The value of cash instruments is determined directly by markets. By contrast, a derivative derives its value from the value of some other financial asset or variable. For example, a stock option is a derivative that derives its value from the value of a stock. An interest rate swap is a derivative because it derives its value from an interest rate index. The asset from which a derivative derives its value is referred to as the underlying asset. The price of a derivative rises and falls in accordance with the value of the underlying asset. Derivatives are designed to offer a return that mirrors the payoff offered by the instruments on which they are based. \n\nBy way of example, a few standard derivatives are listed below. The most commonly-traded derivatives - forwards, futures, options and swaps - will be described in greater detail. \n\nAsian Option - Also called an average option, this is an option that is linked to the average value of an underlying asset on a specific set of dates during the life of the option.\n\nBasket Option - An option with a payoff that is linked to a portfolio or \"basket\" of assets such as the Fortune 500. \n\nAn interest-rate cap is an option that protects the holder from rises in short-term interest rates by making a payment to the holder when an underlying interest rate index exceeds a specified strike or cap rate. \n\nA credit derivative is an OTC derivative designed to transfer credit risk from one party to another. By synthetically creating or eliminating credit exposures, they allow institutions to more effectively manage credit risks. Credit derivatives take many forms. Three basic structures include: credit default, total return and credit linked swaps.\n\nA swaption is an OTC option on a swap. Usually, the underlying swap is a vanilla interest rate swap. Unless stated otherwise, that is how we will use the term in this article. However, the term \"swaption\" might be used to refer to an option on any type of swap. \n\nThere is also a somewhat arbitrary distinction between vanilla and exotic derivatives. The former tend to be simple and more common, the latter more complicated and specialized. There is no definitive rule for distinguishing one from the other, so the distinction is mostly a matter of custom.\n\nDerivatives are further distinguished from cash instruments in that they are contracts between two or more parties. (Note that the major exceptions to this are warrants and convertible bonds which are, in fact, assets).These contracts are promises to convey ownership of an asset rather than the asset itself. Like other contracts, derivatives represent an agreement between two parties; the terms of the agreement are highly flexible and the contract has a fixed beginning and ending date. \n\nInvestors use derivatives to capture profits resulting from price variations in the underlying investment.Because of this, derivatives are often referred to as leveraged investments. Of course, whenever leverage is employed the results, both positive and negative, can be greatly magnified \n\nDerivatives are generally used to hedge risk, but can also be used for speculative purposes. For example, an Asian investor who uses U.S. dollars to buy shares in a U.S. company (traded on a U.S. exchange) would be exposed to exchange-rate risk when she sells the shares and converts dollars back to her home currency. To hedge this risk, the investor could purchase derivatives - currency futures - to lock in a favorable exchange rate. \n\nDespite the risks, derivatives are also attractive to investors because they trade for a fraction of the price of the underlying asset, enabling investors to control more of an asset for less money. \n\nBecause derivatives are contracts, just about anything can be used as an underlying asset. There are even derivatives based on weather data, such as the amount of rain or the number of sunny days in a particular region. \n\nOptions are the most commonly traded type of derivative. An options contract gives the owner the right to buy or sell an asset at a set price on or before a given date. Other products include futures contracts, forward contracts, warrants and swap contracts. The most common underlying assets include stocks, bonds, commodities, currencies, interest rates and market indexes. \n\nKey points to remember:\n\n\nDerivatives are contracts between buyers and sellers. \n\nThey are referred to as \"wasting\" assets because they have a defined and limited life with a set initiation and expiration date. The value of a derivative decreases as it gets closer to the expiration date. \n\nGenerally, payoff is determined or made at the expiration date, although this is not true in all cases.\n\nSometimes no money is exchanged at the beginning of the contract.\n\nCash or spot price is the price an investor would have to pay for immediate purchase.\n\nWe will elaborate on these bullet points as the lessons progress.\n\nExchange-traded vs. over-the-counter derivatives\nLike their underlying cash instruments, some derivatives are traded on established exchanges (the New York Stock Exchange, the French CAC or the Chicago Board of Trade). These are referred to as exchange-traded derivatives and, generally, they have highly standardized terms and features. The advantage of exchange-traded derivatives is that regulated exchanges provide clearing and regulatory safeguards to investors.\n\nMany other derivative instruments, including forwards, swaps and exotic derivatives, are traded outside of the formal, established exchanges. These are over-the-counter or OTC-traded derivatives. They can be created by any two counterparties with highly flexible terms and a nearly infinite number of underlying assets or asset combinations. In the OTC derivatives market, large financial institutions serve as derivatives dealers, customizing derivatives for the specific needs of clients.\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_326", "text": "\nForward Commitments\nA forward commitment is a contract between two (or more) parties who agree to engage in a transaction at a later date and at a specific price, which is given at the start of the contract. It is a customized, privately negotiated agreement to exchange an asset or cash flows at a specified future date at a price agreed on at the trade date. In its simplest form, it is a trade that is agreed to at one point in time but will take place at some later time. For example, two parties might agree today to exchange 500,000 barrels of crude oil for $42.08 a barrel three months from today. Entering a forward contract typically does not require the payment of a fee. \nThere are two major types of forward commitments:\r\n\t\u00a0\n\n\nForward contracts, or forwards, are OTC-traded derivatives with customized terms and features.\n\nFutures contract, or futures, are exchange-traded derivatives with standardized terms. \n\n\nFutures and forwards share some common characteristics:\n\n\nBoth futures and forwards are firm and binding agreements to act at a later date. In most cases this means exchanging an asset at a specific price sometime in the future. \n\nBoth types of derivatives obligate the parties to make a contract to complete the transaction or offset the transaction by engaging in anther transaction that settles each party's obligation to the other. Physical settlement occurs when the actual underlying asset is delivered in exchange for the agreed-upon price. In cases where the contracts are entered into for purely financial reasons (i.e. the engaged parties have no interest in taking possession of the underlying asset), the derivative may be cash settled with a single payment equal to the market value of the derivative at its maturity or expiration.\n\nBoth types of derivatives are considered leveraged instruments because for little or no cash outlay, an investor can profit from price movements in the underlying asset without having to immediately pay for, hold or warehouse that asset. \n\nThey offer a convenient means of hedging or speculating. For example, a rancher can conveniently hedge his grain costs by purchasing corn several months forward. The hedge eliminates price exposure, and it doesn't require an initial outlay of funds to purchase the grain. The rancher is hedged without having to take delivery of or store the grain until it is needed. The rancher doesn't even have to enter into the forward with the ultimate supplier of the grain and there is little or no initial cash outlay. \n\nBoth physical settlement and cash settlement options can be keyed to a wide variety of underlying assets including commodities, short-term debt, Eurodollar deposits, gold, foreign exchange, the S&P 500 stock index, etc.\n\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_327", "text": "\nThe fundamental difference between futures and forwards is that futures are traded on exchanges and forwards trade OTC. The difference in trading venues gives rise to notable differences in the two instruments: \n\n\nFutures are standardized instruments transacted through brokerage firms that hold a \"seat\" on the exchange that trades that particular contract. The terms of a futures contract - including delivery places and dates, volume, technical specifications, and trading and credit procedures - are standardized for each type of contract. Like an ordinary stock trade, two parties will work through their respective brokers, to transact a futures trade. An investor can only trade in the futures contracts that are supported by each exchange. In contrast, forwards are entirely customized and all the terms of the contract are privately negotiated between parties. They can be keyed to almost any conceivable underlying asset or measure. The settlement date, notional amount of the contract and settlement form (cash or physical) are entirely up to the parties to the contract. \n\nForwards entail both market risk and credit risk. Those who engage in futures transactions assume exposure to default by the exchange's clearing house. For OTC derivatives, the exposure is to default by the counterparty who may fail to perform on a forward. The profit or loss on a forward contract is only realized at the time of settlement, so the credit exposure can keep increasing. \n\nWith futures, credit risk mitigation measures, such as regular mark-to-market and margining, are automatically required. The exchanges employ a system whereby counterparties exchange daily payments of profits or losses on the days they occur. Through these margin payments, a futures contract's market value is effectively reset to zero at the end of each trading day. This all but eliminates credit risk.\n\nThe daily cash flows associated with margining can skew futures prices, causing them to diverge from corresponding forward prices. \n\nFutures are settled at the settlement price fixed on the last trading date of the contract (i.e. at the end). Forwards are settled at the forward price agreed on at the trade date (i.e. at the start). \n\nFutures are generally subject to a single regulatory regime in one jurisdiction, while forwards - although usually transacted by regulated firms - are transacted across jurisdictional boundaries and are primarily governed by the contractual relations between the parties. \n\nIn case of physical delivery, the forward contract specifies to whom the delivery should be made. The counterparty on a futures contract is chosen randomly by the exchange. \n\nIn a forward there are no cash flows until delivery, whereas in futures there are margin requirements and periodic margin calls.\n\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_328", "text": "\nA forward is an agreement between two counterparties - a buyer and seller. The buyer agrees to buy an underlying asset from the other party (the seller). The delivery of the asset occurs at a later time, but the price is determined at the time of purchase. Key features of forward contracts are:\n\n\nHighly customized - Counterparties can determine and define the terms and features to fit their specific needs, including when delivery will take place and the exact identity of the underlying asset.\n\nAll parties are exposed to counterparty default risk - This is the risk that the other party may not make the required delivery or payment. \n\nTransactions take place in large, private and largely unregulated markets consisting of banks, investment banks, government and corporations.\n\nUnderlying assets can be a stocks, bonds, foreign currencies, commodities or some combination thereof. The underlying asset could even be interest rates.\n\nThey tend to be held to maturity and have little or no market liquidity. \n\nAny commitment between two parties to trade an asset in the future is a forward contract.\n\n\nExample: Forward Contracts\nLet's assume that you have just taken up sailing and like it so well that you expect you might buy your own sailboat in 12 months. Your sailing buddy, John, owns a sailboat but expects to upgrade to a newer, larger model in 12 months. You and John could enter into a forward contract in which you agree to buy John's boat for $150,000 and he agrees to sell it to you in 12 months for that price. In this scenario, as the buyer, you have entered a long forward contract. Conversely, John, the seller will have the short forward contract. At the end of one year, you find that the current market valuation of John's sailboat is $165,000. Because John is obliged to sell his boat to you for only $150,000, you will have effectively made a profit of $15,000. (You can buy the boat from John for $150,000 and immediately sell it for $165,000.) John, unfortunately, has lost $15,000 in potential proceeds from the transaction. \n\nLike all forward contracts, in this example, no money exchanged hands when the contract was negotiated and the initial value of the contract was zero. \n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_329", "text": "\nFuture contracts are also agreements between two parties in which the buyer agrees to buy an underlying asset from the other party (the seller). The delivery of the asset occurs at a later time, but the price is determined at the time of purchase. \n\n\nTerms and conditions are standardized.\n\nTrading takes place on a formal exchange wherein the exchange provides a place to engage in these transactions and sets a mechanism for the parties to trade these contracts.\n\nThere is no default risk because the exchange acts as a counterparty, guaranteeing delivery and payment by use of a clearing house.\n\nThe clearing house protects itself from default by requiring its counterparties to settle gains and losses or mark to market their positions on a daily basis.\n\nFutures are highly standardized, have deep liquidity in their markets and trade on an exchange. \n\nAn investor can offset his or her future position by engaging in an opposite transaction before the stated maturity of the contract. \n\n\nExample: Future Contracts\nLet's assume that in September the spot or current price for hydroponic tomatoes is $3.25 per bushel and the futures price is $3.50. A tomato farmer is trying to secure a selling price for his next crop, while McDonald's is trying to secure a buying price in order to determine how much to charge for a Big Mac next year. The farmer and the corporation can enter into a futures contract requiring the delivery of 5 million bushels of tomatoes to McDonald's in December at a price of $3.50 per bushel. The contract locks in a price for both parties. It is this contract - and not the grain per se - that can then be bought and sold in the futures market. \n\nIn this scenario, the farmer is the holder of the short position (he has agreed to sell the underlying asset - tomatoes) and McDonald's is the holder of the long position (it has agreed to buy the asset). The price of the contract is 5 million bushels at $3.50 per bushel. \n\nThe profits and losses of a futures contract are calculated on a daily basis. In our example, suppose the price on futures contracts for tomatoes increases to $4 per bushel the day after the farmer and McDonald's enter into their futures contract of $3.50 per bushel. The farmer, as the holder of the short position, has lost $0.50 per bushel because the selling price just increased from the future price at which he is obliged to sell his tomatoes. McDonald's has profited by $0.50 per bushel. \n\nOn the day the price change occurs, the farmer's account is debited $2.5 million ($0.50 per bushel x 5 million bushels) and McDonald's is credited the same amount. Because the market moves daily, futures positions are settled daily as well. Gains and losses from each day's trading are deducted or credited to each party's account. At the expiration of a futures contract, the spot and futures prices normally converge. \n\nMost transactions in the futures market are settled in cash, and the actual physical commodity is bought or sold in the cash market. For example, let's suppose that at the expiration date in December there is a blight that decimates the tomato crop and the spot price rises to $5.50 a bushel. McDonald's has a gain of $2 per bushel on its futures contract but it still has to buy tomatoes. The company's $10 million gain ($2 per bushel x 5 million bushels) will be offset against the higher cost of tomatoes on the spot market. Likewise, the farmer's loss of $10 million is offset against the higher price for which he can now sell his tomatoes. \n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_330", "text": "\nAn option is common form of a derivative. It's a contract, or a provision of a contract, that gives one party (the option holder) the right, but not the obligation to perform a specified transaction with another party (the option issuer or option writer) according to specified terms. Options can be embedded into many kinds of contracts. For example, a corporation might issue a bond with an option that will allow the company to buy the bonds back in ten years at a set price. Standalone options trade on exchanges or OTC. They are linked to a variety of underlying assets. Most exchange-traded options have stocks as their underlying asset but OTC-traded options have a huge variety of underlying assets (bonds, currencies, commodities, swaps, or baskets of assets). \nThere are two main types of options: calls and puts:\n\n\nCall options provide the holder the right (but not the obligation) to purchase an underlying asset at a specified price (the strike price), for a certain period of time. If the stock fails to meet the strike price before the expiration date, the option expires and becomes worthless. Investors buy calls when they think the share price of the underlying security will rise or sell a call if they think it will fall. Selling an option is also referred to as ''writing'' an option. \n\nPut options give the holder the right to sell an underlying asset at a specified price (the strike price). The seller (or writer) of the put option is obligated to buy the stock at the strike price. Put options can be exercised at any time before the option expires. Investors buy puts if they think the share price of the underlying stock will fall, or sell one if they think it will rise. Put buyers - those who hold a \"long\" - put are either speculative buyers looking for leverage or \"insurance\" buyers who want to protect their long positions in a stock for the period of time covered by the option. Put sellers hold a \"short\" expecting the market to move upward (or at least stay stable) A worst-case scenario for a put seller is a downward market turn. The maximum profit is limited to the put premium received and is achieved when the price of the underlyer is at or above the option's strike price at expiration. The maximum loss is unlimited for an uncovered put writer. \n\n\nTo obtain these rights, the buyer must pay an option premium (price). This is the amount of cash the buyer pays the seller to obtain the right that the option is granting them. The premium is paid when the contract is initiated.\n\nIn Level 1, the candidate is expected to know exactly what role short and long positions take, how price movements affect those positions and how to calculate the value of the options for both short and long positions given different market scenarios. For example: \n\n\nQ. Which of the following statements about the value of a call option at expiration is FALSE? \n\n\nA. The short position in the same call option can result in a loss if the stock price exceeds the exercise price.\nB. The value of the long position equals zero or the stock price minus the exercise price, whichever is higher. \nC. The value of the long position equals zero or the exercise price minus the stock price, whichever is higher. \nD. The short position in the same call option has a zero value for all stock prices equal to or less than the exercise price.\n\nA. The correct answer is \"C\". The value of a long position is calculated as exercise price minus stock price. The maximum loss in a long put is limited to the price of the premium (the cost of buying the put option). Answer \"A\" is incorrect because it describes a gain. Answer \"D\" is incorrect because the value can be less than zero (i.e. an uncovered put writer can experience huge losses).\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_331", "text": "\nBoth put and call options have three basic characteristics: exercise price, expiration date and time to expiration. \n\n\nThe buyer has the right to buy or sell the asset.\n\nTo acquire the right of an option, the buyer of the option must pay a price to the seller. This is called the option price or the premium.\n\nThe exercise price is also called the fixed price, strike price or just the strike and is determined at the beginning of the transaction. It is the fixed price at which the holder of the call or put can buy or sell the underlying asset.\n\nExercising is using this right the option grants you to buy or sell the underlying asset. The seller may have a potential commitment to buy or sell the asset if the buyer exercises his right on the option.\n\nThe expiration date is the final date that the option holder has to exercise her right to buy or sell the underlying asset.\n\nTime to expiration is the amount of time from the purchase of the option until the expiration date. At expiration, the call holder will pay the exercise price and receive the underlying securities (or an equivalent cash settlement) if the option expires in the money. (We will discuss the degrees of moneyness later in this session.) The call seller will deliver the securities at the exercise price and receive the cash value of those securities or receive equivalent cash settlement in lieu of delivering the securities.\n\nDefaults on options work the same way as they do with forward contracts. Defaults on over-the counter option transactions are based on counterparties, while exchange-traded options use a clearing house.\n\n\nExample: Call Option\nIBM is trading at 100 today. (June 1, 2005)\n\nThe call option is as follows:Strike price = 120, Date = August 1, 2005,Premium on the call = $3\n\nIn this case, the buyer of the IBM call today has to pay the seller of the IBM call $3 for the right to purchase IBM at $125 on or before August 1, 2005. If the buyer decides to exercise the option on or before August 1, 2005, the seller will have to deliver IBM shares at a price of $125 to the buyer.\n\nExample: Put Option\nIBM is trading at 100 today (June 1, 2005)\n\nPut option is as follows:Strike price = 90, Date = August 1, 2005, Premium on the put = $3.00\n\nIn this case, the buyer of the IBM put has to pay the seller of the IBM call $3 for the right to sell IBM at $90 on or before August 1, 2005. If the buyer of the put decides to exercise the option on or before August 1, 2005, the seller will have to purchase IBM shares at a price of $90.\n\nExample: Interpreting Diagrams\r\n\tFor the exam, you may be asked interpret diagrams such as the following, which shows the value of a put option at expiration.\n\r\n\t\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA typical question about this diagram might be:\n\n\r\n\tQ: Ignoring transaction costs, which of the following statements about the value of the put option at expiration is TRUE? \n\n\nA. The value of the short position in the put is $4 if the stock price is $76. \nB. The value of the long position in the put is $4 if the stock price is $76. \nC. The long put has value when the stock price is below the $80 exercise price. \nD. The value of the short position in the put is zero for stock prices equaling or exceeding $76.\n\nThe correct answer is \"C\". A put option has positive monetary value when the underlying instrument has a current price ($76) below the exercise price ($80). \n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_332", "text": "\nA swap is one of the most simple and successful forms of OTC-traded derivatives. It is a cash-settled contract between two parties to exchange (or \"swap\") cash flow streams. As long as the present value of the streams is equal, swaps can entail almost any type of future cash flow. They are most often used to change the character of an asset or liability without actually having to liquidate that asset or liability. For example, an investor holding common stock can exchange the returns from that investment for lower risk fixed income cash flows - without having to liquidate his equity position.  \r\n\t\u00a0\nThe difference between a forward contract and a swap is that a swap involves a series of payments in the future, whereas a forward has a single future payment.  \n\n\nTwo of the most basic swaps are:\n\nInterest Rate Swap - This is a contract to exchange cash flow streams that might be associated with some fixed income obligations. The most popular interest rate swaps are fixed-for-floating swaps, under which cash flows of a fixed rate loan are exchanged for those of a floating rate loan. \n\nCurrency Swap - This is similar to an interest rate swap except that the cash flows are in different currencies. Currency swaps can be used to exploit inefficiencies in international debt markets. \nFor example, assume that a corporation needs to borrow $10 million euros and the best rate it can negotiate is a fixed 6.7%. In the U.S., lenders are offering 6.45% on a comparable loan. The corporation could take the U.S. loan and then find a third party willing to swap it into an equivalent euro loan. By doing so, the firm would obtain its euros at more favorable terms. Cash flow streams are often structured so that payments are synchronized, or occur on the same dates. This allows cash flows to be netted against each other (so long as the cash flows are in the same currency). Typically, the principal (or notional) amounts of the loans are netted to zero and the periodic interest payments are scheduled to occur on that same dates so they can also be netted against one another. \nAs is obvious from the above example, swaps are private, negotiated and mostly unregulated transactions (although FASB 133 has begun to impose some regulations). \n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_333", "text": "\nToday's sophisticated international markets have helped foster the rapid growth in derivative instruments. In the hands of knowledgeable investors, derivatives can derive profit from: \n\n\nChanges in interest rates and equity markets around the world\n\nCurrency exchange rate shifts\n\nChanges in global supply and demand for commodities such as agricultural products, precious and industrial metals, and energy products such as oil and natural gas\n\nAdding some of the wide variety of derivative instruments available to a traditional portfolio of investments can provide global diversification in financial instruments and currencies, help hedge against inflation and deflation, and generate returns that are not correlated with more traditional investments. The two most widely recognized benefits attributed to derivative instruments are price discovery and risk management. \n\n\n1. Price Discovery\nFutures market prices depend on a continuous flow of information from around the world and require a high degree of transparency. A broad range of factors (climatic conditions, political situations, debt default, refugee displacement, land reclamation and environmental health, for example) impact supply and demand of assets (commodities in particular) - and thus the current and future prices of the underlying asset on which the derivative contract is based. This kind of information and the way people absorb it constantly changes the price of a commodity. This process is known as price discovery. \n\n\n\n\nWith some futures markets, the underlying assets can be geographically dispersed, having many spot (or current) prices in existence. The price of the contract with the shortest time to expiration often serves as a proxy for the underlying asset. \n\nSecond, the price of all future contracts serve as prices that can be accepted by those who trade the contracts in lieu of facing the risk of uncertain future prices. \n\nOptions also aid in price discovery, not in absolute price terms, but in the way the market participants view the volatility of the markets. This is because options are a different form of hedging in that they protect investors against losses while allowing them to participate in the asset's gains. \n\n\n\n\n\nAs we will see later, if investors think that the markets will be volatile, the prices of options contracts will increase. This concept will be explained later.\n\n2. Risk Management\nThis could be the most important purpose of the derivatives market. Risk management is the process of identifying the desired level of risk, identifying the actual level of risk and altering the latter to equal the former. This process can fall into the categories of hedging and speculation. \n\nHedging has traditionally been defined as a strategy for reducing the risk in holding a market position while speculation referred to taking a position in the way the markets will move. Today, hedging and speculation strategies, along with derivatives, are useful tools or techniques that enable companies to more effectively manage risk. \n\n3. They Improve Market Efficiency for the Underlying Asset\nFor example, investors who want exposure to the S&P 500 can buy an S&P 500 stock index fund or replicate the fund by buying S&P 500 futures and investing in risk-free bonds. Either of these methods will give them exposure to the index without the expense of purchasing all the underlying assets in the S&P 500.\n\nIf the cost of implementing these two strategies is the same, investors will be neutral as to which they choose. If there is a discrepancy between the prices, investors will sell the richer asset and buy the cheaper one until prices reach equilibrium. In this context, derivatives create market efficiency. \n\n4. Derivatives Also Help Reduce Market Transaction Costs\nBecause derivatives are a form of insurance or risk management, the cost of trading in them has to be low or investors will not find it economically sound to purchase such \"insurance\" for their positions\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_334", "text": "\nOptions offer the potential for huge gains and huge losses. While the potential for gain is alluring, their complexity makes them appropriate for only sophisticated investors with a high tolerance for risk. \r\n\t\u00a0\n\n\nWhen a derivative fails to help investors achieve their objectives, the derivative itself is blamed for the ensuing losses when, in fact, it's often the investor who did not fully understand how it should be used, its inherent risk, etc. \n\nSome view derivatives as a form of legalized gambling enabling users to make bets on the market. However, derivatives offer benefits that extend beyond those of gambling by making markets more efficient, helping to manage risk and helping investors to discover asset prices. \n\n\nWhile professional traders and money managers can use derivatives effectively, the odds that a casual investor will be able to generate profits by trading in derivatives are mitigated by the fundamental characteristics of the instrument:\n\nLifespan - Derivatives are \"time-wasting\" assets. As each day passes and the expiration date approaches, you lose more and more \"time\" premium and the option's value decreases. \n\nDirection and Market Timing - In order to make money with many derivatives, investors must accurately predict the direction in which the market or index will move (up or down) and the minimum magnitude of the move during a set period of time. A mistake here almost guarantees a substantial investment loss. \n\nCosts - The bid/ask spreads of more common derivatives such as options can be daunting. An option with a bid of 5.25 and an ask of 5.875 means an investor could buy a round lot (100 units) for $587.50 but could only sell them for $525, resulting in an immediate loss of $61.50 before factoring in commissions. \n\r\n\t\u00a0\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_335", "text": "\nArbitrage opportunities exist when the prices of similar assets are set at different levels. This opportunity allows an investor to achieve a profit with zero risk and limited funds by simply selling the asset in the overpriced market and simultaneously buying it in the cheaper market. \n\nThis buying and selling of the asset will push the cheaper asset's price up and the higher asset price down. This process will continue until the asset price is equal in both markets. \n\nAchieving this equilibrium through buying and selling is referred to as the law of one price. This law may look like it has been violated at times, but this usually is usually not the case once you factor in financing or delivery costs associated with the different markets.\n\n\nFor example, on exchange A IBN is trading at $25 and on exchange B IBN is trading at $30 dollars. If you buy IBN on exchange A and simultaneously sell it on exchange B, you can net a profit of $5 with out any risk or any outlay of cash.\n\nAs people continue to buy on exchange A, the price of IBN will increase and all of the selling of IBN on exchange B will force the price down until equilibrium has been reached. This is how arbitrage works to make the marketplace efficient. \n\n\nAdditional information about arbitrage and its theories: \n\n\nTheoretically, the large number of market participants combined with real-time price-setting mechanisms eliminates the opportunity to generate risk-free profits. \n\nThis leads to an important question: If there are no arbitrage opportunities (i.e. opportunities to earn a risk-free profit), why does the industry survive? One reason is that individual investors may have different views on how, why and to what degree market prices are off kilter. Also, investors are reluctant to believe that there are no arbitrage opportunities and so they spend a good deal of time watching price movements, ferreting out inconsistencies and trading on those they perceive to exist. The process itself ensures that any potential arbitrage opportunities will be quickly discovered and eliminated. If investors believed there were no arbitrage opportunities and were no longer vigilant about identifying and exploiting price differentials, the lack of continuous oversight might, in itself, lead to arbitrage opportunities In other words, disbelief concerning the absence of arbitrage opportunities is required to maintain its legitimacy as a principle.\n\nRelatively efficient markets have either no arbitrage opportunities or the market participants quickly remove them. The opportunity can occur, but only through chance and it would be considered an abnormal return\n\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_336", "text": "\nThe differences between long and short positions in forward markets are as follows:\n\n\nThe long position holder is the buyer of the contract and the short position holder is the seller of the contract.\n\nThe long position will take the delivery of the asset and pay the seller of the asset the contract value, while the seller is obligated to deliver the asset versus the cash value of the contract at the origination date of this transaction.\n\nWhen it comes to default, both parties are at risk because typically no cash is exchanged at the beginning of the transaction. However, some transactions do require that one or both sides put up some form of collateral to protect them from the defaulted party.\n\n\nProcedures for Settling a Forward Contract at Expiration\nA forward contact at expiration can be settled in one of two ways:\n\n\nPhysical Delivery - Refers to an option or futures contract that requires the actual underlying asset to be delivered on the specified delivery date, rather than being traded out with offsetting contracts. Most derivatives are not actually exercised, but are traded out before their delivery dates. However, physical delivery still occurs with some trades: it is most common with commodities, but can also occur with other financial instruments. Settlement by physical delivery is carried out by clearing brokers or their agents. Promptly after the last day of trading, the regulated exchange's clearing organization will report a purchase and sale of the underlying asset at the previous day's settlement price (also referred to as the \"invoice price\"). Traders who hold a short position in a physically settled security futures contract to expiration are required to make delivery of the underlying asset. Those who already own the assets may tender them to the appropriate clearing organization. Traders who do not own assets are obligated to purchase them at the current price.\n\nExchanges specify the conditions of delivery for the contracts they cover. Acceptable locations for delivery (in the case of commodities or energies) and requirements as to the quality, grade or nature of the underlying asset to be delivered are regulated by the exchanges. For example, only certain Treasury bonds may be delivered under the Chicago Board of Trade's Treasury bond future. Only certain growths of coffee may be delivered under the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange's coffee future. In many commodity or energy markets, parties want to settle futures by delivery, but exchange rules are too restrictive for their needs. For example, the New York Mercantile Exchange requires that natural gas be delivered only at the Henry Hub in Louisiana, a location that may not be convenient for all futures traders. \n\n\n\nCash Settlement - Refers to an option or futures contract that requires the counterparties to the contract to net out the cash difference in the value of their positions. The appropriate party receives the cash difference.In the case of cash settlement, no actual assets are delivered at the expiration of a futures contract. Instead, traders must settle any open positions by making or receiving a cash payment based on the difference between the final settlement price and the previous day's settlement price. Under normal circumstances, the final settlement price for a cash-settled contract will reflect the opening price for the underlying asset. Once this payment is made, neither the buyer nor the seller of the futures contract has any further obligations on the contract.\n\n\nExample: Settling a Forward Contract\nLet's return to our sailboat example from the first part of this section. Assume that at the end of 12 months you are a bit ambivalent about sailing. In this case, you could settle your forward contract with John in one of two ways:\n\n\nPhysical Delivery - John delivers that sailboat to you and you pay him $150,000, as agreed. \n\nCash Settlement - John sends you a check for $15,000 (The difference between your contract's purchase price of $150,000 and the sail boat's current market value of $165,000). \n\n\nThe same options are available if the current market price is lower than the forward contract's settlement price. If John's sailboat decreases in value to $135,000, you could simply pay John $15,000 to settle the contract, or you could pay him $150,000 and take physical possession of the boat. (You would still suffer a $15,000 loss when you sold the boat for the current price of $135,000.)\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_337", "text": "\nParties to a futures contract may also terminate the contract prior to expiration through an offset. Offset is the transaction of a reversing trade on the exchange. If you are long 20 March soybean futures traded on the Chicago Board of Trade, you can close the position by taking an offsetting short position in 20 March soybean contracts on the same exchange. There will be a final margining at the end of the day, and then the position will be closed. In other words, if you buy a futures contract and subsequently sell a comparable contract, you have offset your position and the contract is extinguished. Offset trades must match in respect to the underlying asset, delivery dates, quantity, etc., or the original position will not be effectively terminated. In such cases, price movements in the original contract will continue to result in gains or losses. \n\nCompare this to the forward market wherein if you buy a forward contract and then sell an identical forward contract you are left with obligations under two contracts - one long and one short\n\nDefault Risk and Early Termination\nDefault risk on early termination only applies to forward contracts because there is no default risk on futures. (As we stated earlier, futures trades made on a formal exchange are cleared through a clearing organization, which acts as the buyer to all sellers and the seller to all buyers. The clearing house acts as a counterparty, guaranteeing delivery and payment and nullifying any default risk.) \n\nForward contracts are negotiated agreements between buyer and seller. To enter into a forward contract, it is necessary to find someone who wants to buy exactly what you want to sell when and where you want to sell it. Without a formal exchange and clearing house to guarantee delivery and payment, there is always a chance that either the buyer or the seller will default on an obligation. If one of these counterparties fails, the other is still responsible for performing under the contract. Traders in forward contracts who re-enter the market to execute a reversing trade prior to the expiration date will effectively increase their default risk exposure because they will be dealing with two different counterparties, both of which have to live up to their ends of the bargain. To extinguish default risk on a forward contract, a trader must place the reversing position with the samecounterparty and under the same terms as in the originally contract. Obviously, this makes it difficult to get out of a forward contract prior to termination. \n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_338", "text": "\nEnd users of forward contracts vary across a broad range of sectors. In general, end-users have specific risk management concerns that can be mitigated by an appropriate forward contract. However, because forward contracts are not found on a formal exchange, end-users must find a counterparty to their contracts. A dealer is used find a complimentary counterparty that can provide a financial transaction to solve the problem. The problem could be that the end user wants to reduce or eliminate risk or just wants to take a position on the way the market may move in the future. End users are typically corporations, nonprofit organizations and governments. Below are two examples of situations in which end-users can mitigate risk with forward contracts. \n\nAn engineering firm based in Rome, Italy, has a contract with an American company for six months of work. The Italian company is being paid in two installments: the first payment at the start of the contract and the final payment on the closing date of the contract. The Italian company arranges a closed forward contract for the final payment. This protects the company against currency fluctuations and establishes how much the company will receive in euros for its final payment. This allows the company to avoid losing revenue unexpectedly as a result of rate fluctuations. \n\nAn importer in Chicago is bringing in a line of ceramics from Spain. The stock is due to arrive in the U.S. in three shipments over the next two months. Because the importer will pay for each shipment on arrival, the importing company arranges for an open forward contract equal to the value of the entire order in euros. The open contract allows the importing company to make a series of payments by drawing down on the contract amount throughout the contract period. Thanks to the forward contract, the importer knows exactly how much it needs to pay for the shipment in U.S. dollars, rather than having this amount change due to rate fluctuations between the time it books the order and when the shipment arrives.\n\nFarmers, manufacturers, importers and exporters are typical end-users who hedge their positions by buying or selling in the futures market to secure the future price of a commodity intended to be sold at a later date in the cash market.\n\nOther market participants, however, do not aim to minimize risk but rather to benefit from the inherently risky nature of the futures market. These are the speculators, and they aim to profit from the very price change that hedgers are protecting themselves against. Hedgers want to minimize their risk no matter what they're investing in, while speculators want to increase their risk and maximize their profits. Unlike the hedger, the speculator does not actually seek to own the commodity in question. Rather, he or she will enter the market seeking profits by offsetting rising and declining prices through the buying and selling of contracts.\n\nDealer\nA dealer helps facilitate the trading and structure of these transactions based on the end user's specific needs and goals. Dealers may take the other side of the trade for the end user or a dealer may find another counterparty that has the exact opposite needs of the end user. A dealer differs from an agent in that it takes ownership of the asset, and thereby is exposed to some risk. A dealer has ownership, even if only for an instant, between a purchase from one party and a sale to another party, and is thus compensated by the spread between the price paid and the price received. \nIndividuals or firms may act as either a broker or a dealer in separate transactions. This helps the dealer reduce the end user's risk from derivatives and may allow the dealer to earn additional revenue by buying and selling these contracts with his clientele. Dealers tend to be broker/dealers and/or large global banking institutions such as JP Morgan Chase, Citigroup and UBS Warburg to name a few of them.\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_339", "text": "\nAn equity forward is a contract for the purchase of an individual stock, a stock portfolio or a stock index at some future date.\nAn equity forward on an individual stock allows an investor to sell his or her stock at some future date at a guaranteed price. If that guaranteed price is below the market price, the investor will still receive the guaranteed price. If the market price is above the guaranteed price, the investor will only receive the guaranteed price and not be able to participate in any market increase above that price. \nExample 1: Assume that a client owns IBN at 100 and wants to sell IBN stock in six months to raise some cash. The client can enter into an equity forward in which he will receive a price of $125. \nIf the price remains at or below $125, the client will receive $125 per share in six months. \nIf the stock price is at $130, the client will still have to delivery the shares to the counterparty and will only receive $125 per share, losing $5 on the transaction.\n\nForward contracts on a stock portfolio work the same way as on an individual basis. Instead of entering into separate contracts for each of the individual securities in the portfolio, which could be costly in terms of fees, the manager can give a list of securities in the portfolio to the dealer, who will develop a quote of the price for which the dealer would purchase the securities at a future date. \nExample 2: As an example, if the dealer quotes $15,000 for six securities in your portfolio and you decide to enter into the contract, you will receive that amount at the expiration of the contract.\nForward contracts on stock indexes afford portfolio managers a way to protect the value of their portfolios or to try to reduce and/or eliminate risk in a portfolio that mimics a major index. Instead of having a contract for the individual securities, the manager could enter into a forward contract to sell the index at a future date. \nLet's say that you want to protect your portfolio of S&P 500 securities. You contact a dealer who gives you a quote of $5,000 on a forward contract for $170,000,000 to sell the index. These contracts are typically settled in cash payments instead of actual delivery. If the index were to drop by 2%, your portfolio would lose $3,400,000 (170,000,000 x .02). Because you entered into a forward contract with the dealer to sell the index, you benefit from the market decline of 2% to the tune of $3,400,000 (170,000,000 x .02). Or, to view it another way, you can purchase the index at the future date of the contract at $16,660,000 and sell it to the dealer at $170,000,000. As you can see, the gain from the forward contract zeros out the loss on the portfolio from the market decline and protects the portfolio.\n\u00a0\n\nLook Out!\n\t\t\tDividends do have an effect on forwards; however, when you compare the effect in a risk management perspective for a portfolio or index, dividends have a minor impact when compared to the price movements in the equities that underlie the index or portfolio.\n\nMost forwards do not pay dividends except for forwards that are \"total return\" forwards. Total return forwards take into consideration the payments and reinvestment of dividends within the index in addition to the return on the index and the payoff of any forward contract based on it.\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_340", "text": "\nThe basic characteristics of a forward contract on a bond are very much like those of equity. A bond pays a coupon similar to an equity paying a dividend. \nThe differences are:\n\n\nBonds mature; this means that contracts must also mature before the maturity date.\n\nBonds can have calls and convertibility.\n\nBonds have a default risk, which means the contract must include remedies for this risk in case it occurs. \n\n\nForward contracts can be on an individual issue as well as on a portfolio of bonds or on a bond index. \n\nFor zero-coupon bonds like a T-bill, a forward contract has one party agreeing to buy the T-bill at a later date, but before its maturity, at a price that is agreed to at the time the contract is made. \r\n\t\u00a0\nLook Out!\r\n\tRemember that T-bills are sold at a discount to par and are quoted in terms of the discount rate.  \n\n\nExample: Forward Contracts on Zero-Coupon Bonds\nA 180 day T-bill is selling at 3.5%. The par of a $1 par value, therefore, would equal 1 - .035(180/360) = $ 0.9825. If the bond is held to maturity it will pay the investor $1. The 360 days in the above formula is market convention for the number of days in a year.\n\nFor coupon-paying bonds, interest payments, which are typically semi-annual and can sell at a premium or discount to the bond's par value, must be taken into account. Prices are usually quoted without the interest rate that has accrued from the last payment. We will typically work with a bond's full price, the price that includes accrued interest. Prices are quoted by stating the yield. Forward contracts call for the delivery of a bond prior to the bond's maturity where the short pays the long the agreed-upon price.\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_341", "text": "\nEurodollar time deposits are part of the huge foreign exchange market. Historically, such deposits were held mostly by European banks and financial institutions, and became known as \"Eurodollars\". As of April 2006, China holds the largest foreign exchange reserves, much of which are denominated in U.S. currency. Such deposits are now available in many countries worldwide, but they continue to be referred to as \"Eurodollars\", regardless of the location.\n\nEurodollar time deposits are U.S. dollars on deposit outside the United States, either with a foreign bank or a subsidiary of a U.S. bank. Eurodollars have two basic characteristics: they are short-term obligations to pay dollars and they are obligations of banking offices located outside the U.S. In principle, there is no hard and fast line between Eurodollars and other dollar-denominated claims. The interest paid for these dollar deposits generally is higher than for funds deposited in U.S. banks because the foreign banks are riskier - they will not be supported or nationalized by the U.S. government upon default. Furthermore, they may pay higher rates of interest because they are not regulated by the U.S. government. They are backed by the full faith and credit of the local domestic bank and are issued by its offshore branch. Eurodollar time deposits are designed for corporate, commercial, institutional and high-net-worth investors who want a short-term, high-yield money market investment. Foreign commercial banks such as the Bank of London and South America, Ltd., merchant banks such as Morgan Grenfell and Co., Ltd., and many of the foreign branches of U.S. commercial banks are engaged in Eurodollar business. Funds placed with these institutions may be owned by anyone- U.S. or foreign residents or citizens, individuals or corporations or governments. \n\nExample: Time Deposits\nTime deposits are structured in the following way. A London bank, Bank A, needs to borrow $5 million for 30 days. It gets a quote from another bank, Bank C, for a rate of 6%. If Bank A takes the deal, it will owe Bank C $ 5 million x (1 + 0.06(30/360)) = $5,025,000 in 30 days. Unlike the T-bill market, interest is not deducted from the principal but is added on to the face value just like your own bank loans. This procedure is called add-on interest.\n\nLIBOR or the London Interbank Offer Rate\nLIBOR, which stands for London Interbank Offered Rate, is the interest rate paid on interbank deposits in the international money markets (also called the Eurocurrency markets). Because Eurocurrency deposits priced at LIBOR are almost continually traded in highly liquid markets, LIBOR is commonly used as a benchmark for short-term interest rates in setting loan and deposit rates and as the floating rate on an interest rate swap. It's considered one of the most important barometers of the international cost of money, and LIBOR has historically reflected money market rates more accurately than the prime- and Treasury-based indexes.\n\n\nMost commonly used in derivative contracts\n\nEven though it is a loan outside of the U.S., it is still considered the best representative rate on a dollar borrowed by a (non-government) private borrower \n\nAlso includes many branches of banks from outside the U.K.\n\n\nLIBOR is quoted on a one-month, three-months, six-months or yearly basis. Six-month LIBOR is most commonly quoted for mortgages. Both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac use LIBOR as an index for the loans they purchase. \n\nEuribor\nEuribor (Euro Interbank Offered Rate) is similar to LIBOR except it uses euros and euro deposits in the lending and borrowing between banks, instead of dollars. Euribor is the rate at which euro interbank term deposits are offered by one prime bank to another prime bank. It is compiled in Frankfurt and published by the European Central Bank. Euribor is the benchmark rate of the large euro money market and is sponsored by the European Banking Federation (FBE), which represents the interests of 4,500 banks in 24 Member States of the European Union and in Iceland, Norway and Switzerland and by the Financial Markets Association (ACI).\n\nThe choice of banks quoting for Euribor is based on a number of market criteria, but all banks are selected to ensure that the diversity of the euro money market is adequately reflected, thereby making Euribor an efficient and representative benchmark.\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_342", "text": "\n\u00a0\nAn FRA is a contract in which the underlying rate is simply an interest payment, not a bond or time deposit, made in dollars, euribor or any other currency at a rate that is appropriate for that currency. A forward rate agreement is a forward contact on a short-term interest rate, usually LIBOR, in which cash flow obligations at maturity are calculated on a notional amount and based on the difference between a predetermined forward rate and the market rate prevailing on that date. The settlement date of an FRA is the date on which cash flow obligations are determined. \n\n\nThe structure is the same for all currencies.\n\nFRAs mature in a certain number of days and are based on a rate that applies to an instrument maturing in a certain number of days, measured from the maturity of the FRA.\n\nThe structure is as follows: The short party or dealer and the long party or end-user will agree on an interest rate, a time interval and a \"hypothetical\" contract amount. The end-user benefits if rates increase (she has locked-in a lower rate with the dealer). Because the end-user is long, the dealer must be short the interest rate and will benefit if rates decrease. \n\nThe contact covers a notional amount but only interest rate payments on that amount are considered.\n\nIt is important to note that even though the FRA may settle in fewer days than the underlying rate (i.e. the number of days to maturity in the underlying instrument), the rate that the dealer quotes has to be evaluated in relation to the underlying rate. \n\nBecause there are two-day figures in the quotes, participants have come up with a system of quotes such as 3 x 9, which means the contract expires in three months and in six months, or the nine months from the formation of the contract, interest will be paid on the underlying Eurodollar time deposit upon which the contract's rate is based. \n\nOther examples include 1 x 3 with the contract expiring in one month based on a 60-day LIBOR, or 6 x 12, which means the contract expires in six months based on the underlying rate of a 180 day LIBOR.\n\nUsually based on exact months such as 30 day LIBOR or 60 day LIBOR not 37 days and 134 day LIBOR. If a client wants to tailor an FRA, it is likely that a dealer will do it for the client. When this occurs, it is considered to bean off-the-run contract\n\nThe best way to see it is through an example, which we will cover in the next section.\n\n\nCalculation of Payment at Expiration of FRA\nLet's set up the transaction:\n\n\nDealer quotes a rate of 4% on this instrument and end user agrees. He is hoping that rates will increase. \n\nExpiration is in 90 days.\n\nThe notional amount is $ 5 million.\n\nThe underlying interest rate is the 180 LIBOR time deposit.\n\nIn 90 days the 180-day LIBOR is at 5%. That 5% interest will be paid 180 days later.\n\n\n\nSo:  5,000,000 x ((0.05 - 0.04) (180/360)) = $ 47,600\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1 + 0.05 (180/360) \n\nBecause rates increased, the long party or the end user will receive $47,600 from the short party or the dealer.\n\nIf the rates were to decrease, the long party or the end user would have to pony up a payment that would be the difference between the quoted rate and the 180-day LIBOR rate.\n\nIn written terms, the formula looks like this for the party going long:\n\n\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\tFormula 16.1\r\n\t\t\t\t((Underlying rate at expiration - Forward contract rate)(days in underlying rate/360))\n1 + underlying rate (days in underlying rate/360)\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nForward contract rate = rate the two parties agree will be paid\n\nDays in underlying rate = number of days to maturity on the underlying instrument\n\n\nIn the numerator, we see that the contract is paying the difference between the actual rate that exists in the marketplace on the expiration date and the agreed-upon rate at the beginning of the contract. It is adjusted for the fact that the rate applies to a 180-day rate multiplied by the notional amount.\n\nThe divisor is there because when the rates are quoted in the market, they are based on the assumption that they will accrue interest, which will be paid at a certain time. So the FRA payoff needs to be adjusted to reflect the fact that the rate implies a payment that will occur in the future, say 180 days using our above example. Discounting the payment at the current LIBOR does the adjustment.\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_343", "text": "\nForeign currency forward contracts are used as a foreign currency hedge when an investor has an obligation to either make or take a foreign currency payment at some point in the future. If the date of the foreign currency payment and the last trading date of the foreign currency forwards contract are matched up, the investor has in effect \"locked in\" the exchange rate payment amount.\nBy locking into a forward contract to sell a currency, the seller sets a future exchange rate with no upfront cost. For example, a U.S. exporter signs a contract today to sell hardware to a French importer. The terms of the contract require the importer to pay euros in six months' time. The exporter now has a known euro receivable. Over the next six months, the dollar value of the euro receivable will rise or fall depending on fluctuations in the exchange rate. To mitigate his uncertainty about the direction of the exchange rate, the exporter may elect to lock in the rate at which he will sell the euros and buy dollars in six months. To accomplish this, he hedges the euro receivable by locking in a forward. \nThis arrangement leaves the exporter fully protected should the currency depreciate below the contract level. However, he gives up all benefits if the currency appreciates. In fact, the seller of a forward rate faces unlimited costs should the currency appreciate. This is a major drawback for many companies that consider this to be the true cost of a forward contract hedge. For companies that consider this to be only an opportunity cost, this aspect of a forward is an acceptable \"cost\". For this reason, forwards are one of the least forgiving hedging instruments because they require the buyer to accurately estimate the future value of the exposure amount.\nLike other future and forward contracts, foreign currency futures contracts have standard contract sizes, time periods, settlement procedures and are traded on regulated exchanges throughout the world. Foreign currency forwards contracts may have different contract sizes, time periods and settlement procedures than futures contracts. Foreign currency forwards contracts are considered over-the-counter (OTC) because there is no centralized trading location and transactions are conducted directly between parties via telephone and online trading platforms at thousands of locations worldwide.\nKey Points:\nDeveloped and grew in the late '70s when governments relaxed their control over their currencies\nUsed mainly by banks and corporations to manage foreign exchange risk\nAllows the user to \"lock in\" or set a future exchange rate.\nParties can deliver the currency or settle the difference in rates with cash.\n\nExample: Currency Forward ContractsCorporation A has a foreign sub in Italy that will be sending it 10 million euros in six months. Corp. A will need to swap the euro for the euros it will be receiving from the sub. In other words, Corp. A is long euros and short dollars. It is short dollars because it will need to purchase them in the near future. Corp. A can wait six months and see what happens in the currency markets or enter into a currency forward contract. To accomplish this, Corp. A can short the forward contract, or euro, and go long the dollar.\nCorp. A goes to Citigroup and receives a quote of .935 in six months. This allows Corp. A to buy dollars and sell euros. Now Corp. A will be able to turn its 10 million euros into 10 million x .935 = 935,000 dollars in six months. \nSix months from now if rates are at .91, Corp. A will be ecstatic because it will have realized a higher exchange rate. If the rate has increased to .95, Corp. A would still receive the .935 it originally contracts to receive from Citigroup, but in this case, Corp. A will not have received the benefit of a more favorable exchange rate. \n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_344", "text": "\n\u00a0\nFutures differ from forwards in several instances:\n\n\nA forward contract is a private transaction - a futures contract is not. Futures contracts are reported to the future's exchange, the clearing house and at least one regulatory agency. The price is recorded and available from pricing services.\n\nA future takes place on an organized exchange where the all of the contract's terms and conditions, except price, are formalized. Forwards are customized to meet the user's special needs. The future's standardization helps to create liquidity in the marketplace enabling participants to close out positions before expiration.\n\nForwards have credit risk, but futures do not because a clearing house guarantees against default risk by taking both sides of the trade and marking to market their positions every night. Mark to market is the process of converting daily gains and losses into actual cash gains and losses each night. As one party loses on the trade the other party gains, and the clearing house moves the payments for the counterparty through this process.\n\nForwards are basically unregulated, while future contract are regulated at the federal government level. The regulation is there to ensure that no manipulation occurs, that trades are reported in a timely manner and that the professionals in the market are qualified and honest.\n\n\nCharacteristics of Futures Contracts\nIn a futures contract there are two parties:\n\n\nThe long position, or buyer, agrees to purchase the underlying at a later date or at the expiration date at a price that is agreed to at the beginning of the transaction. Buyers benefit from price increases.\n\nThe short position, or seller, agrees to sell the underlying at a later date or at the expiration date at a price that is agreed to at the beginning of the transaction. Sellers benefit from price decreases.\n\n\nPrices change daily in the marketplace and are marked to market on a daily basis.\n\nAt expiration, the buyer takes delivery of the underlying from the seller or the parties can agree to make a cash settlement.\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_345", "text": "\n\u00a0\nIn the stock market, a margin is a loan that is made to the investor. It helps the investor to reduce the amount of her own cash that she uses to purchase securities. This creates leverage for the investor, causing gains and losses to be amplified. The loan must be paid back with interest. \n\n\nMargin % = Market Value of the stock - Market value of the debt divided by the market value of the stock\n\nAn initial margin loan in the U.S can be as much as 50%. The market value of the securities minus the amount borrowed can often be less than 50%, but the investor must keep a balance of 25-30% of the total market value of the securities in the margin account as a maintenance margin.\n\nA margin in the futures market is the amount of cash an investor must put up to open an account to start trading. This cash amount is the initial margin requirement and it is not a loan. It acts as a down payment on the underlying asset and helps ensure that both parties fulfill their obligations. Both buyers and sellers must put up payments. \n\nInitial Margin\nThis is the initial amount of cash that must be deposited in the account to start trading contracts. It acts as a down payment for the delivery of the contract and ensures that the parties honor their obligations.\n\nMaintenance Margin\nThis is the balance a trader must maintain in his or her account as the balance changes due to price fluctuations. It is some fraction - perhaps 75% - of initial margin for a position. If the balance in the trader's account drops below this margin, the trader is required to deposit enough funds or securities to bring the account back up to the initial margin requirement. Such a demand is referred to as a margin call. The trader can close his position in this case but he is still responsible for the loss incurred. However, if he closes his position, he is no longer at risk of the position losing additional funds.\n\nFutures (which are exchange-traded) and forwards (which are traded OTC) treat margin accounts differently. When a trader posts collateral to secure an OTC derivative obligation such as a forward, the trader legally still owns the collateral. With futures contracts, money transferred from a margin account to an exchange as a margin payment legally changes hands. A deposit in a margin account at a broker is collateral. It legally still belongs to the client, but the broker can take possession of it any time to satisfy obligations arising from the client's futures positions\n\nVariation Margin\nThis is the amount of cash or collateral that brings the account up to the initial margin amount once it drops below the maintenance margin.\n\nSettlement Price\nSettlement price is established by the appropriate exchange settlement committee at the close of each trading session. It is the official price that will be used by the clearing house to determine net gains or losses, margin requirements and the next day's price limits. Most often, the settlement price represents the average price of the last few trades that occur on the day. It is the official price set by the clearing house and it helps to process the day's gains and loses in marking to market the accounts. However, each exchange may have its own particular methodology. For example, on NYMEX (the New York Mercantile Exchange) and COMEX (The New York Commodity Exchange) settlement price calculations depend of the level of trading activity. In contract months with significant activity, the settlement price is derived by calculating the weighted average of the prices at which trades were conducted during the closing range, a brief period at the end of the day. Contract months with little or no trading activity on a given day are settled based on the spread relationships to the closest active contract month, while on the Tokyo Financial Exchange settlement price is calculated as the theoretical value based on the expected volatility for each series set by the exchange. \r\n\t\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nLook Out!\r\n\t\t\t\tRemember that settlement price is NOT the closing price.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_346", "text": "\n\u00a0\nMost U.S. futures exchanges offer two ways to enact a trade - the traditional floor-trading process (also called \"open outcry\") and electronic trading. The basic steps are essentially the same in either format: Customers submit orders that are executed - filled - by other traders who take equal but opposite positions, selling at prices at which other customers buy or buying at prices at which other customers sell. The differences are described below. \n\nOpen outcry trading is the more traditional form of trading in the U.S. Brokers take orders (either bids to buy or offers to sell) by telephone or computer from traders (their customers). Those orders are then communicated orally to brokers in a trading pit. The pits are octagonal, multi-tiered areas on the floor of the exchange where traders conduct business. The traders wear different colored jackets and badges that indicate who they work for and what type of traders they are (FCM or local). It's called \"open outcry\" because traders shout and use various hand signals to relay information and the price at which they are willing to trade. Trades are executed (matches are made) when the traders agree on a price and the number of contracts either through verbal communication or simply some sort of motion such as a nod. The traders then turn their trade tickets over to their clerks who enter the transaction into the system. Customers are then notified of their trades and pertinent information about each trade is sent to the clearing house and brokerages. \n\nIn electronic trading, customers (who have been pre-approved by a brokerage for electronic trading) send buy or sell orders directly from their computers to an electronic marketplace offered by the relevant exchange. There are no brokers involved in the process. Traders see the various bids and offers on their computers. The trade is executed by the traders lifting bids or hitting offers on their computer screens. The trading pit is, in essence, the trading screen and the electronic market participants replace the brokers standing in the pit. Electronic trading offers much greater insight into pricing because the top five current bids and offers are posted on the trading screen for all market participants to see. Computers handle all trading activity - the software identifies matches of bids and offers and generally fills orders according to a first-in, first-out (FIFO) process. Dissemination of information is also faster on electronic trades. Trades made on CME\u00ae Globex\u00ae, for example, happen in milliseconds and are instantaneously broadcast to the public. In open outcry trading, however, it can take from a few seconds to minutes to execute a trade. \n\nPrice Limit\nThis is the amount a futures contract's price can move in one day. Price limits are usually set in absolute dollar amounts - the limit could be $5, for example. This would mean that the price of the contract could not increase or decrease by more than $5 in a single day.\n\nLimit Move\nA limit move occurs when a transaction takes place that would exceed the price limit. This freezes the price at the price limit.\n\nLimit Up\nThe maximum amount by which the price of a futures contract may advance in one trading day. Some markets close trading of these contracts when the limit up is reached, others allow trading to resume if the price moves away from the day's limit. If there is a major event affecting the market's sentiment toward a particular commodity, it may take several trading days before the contract price fully reflects this change. On each trading day, the trading limit will be reached before the market's equilibrium contract price is met. \n\nLimit Down\nThis is when the price decreases and is stuck at the lower price limit. The maximum amount by which the price of a commodity futures contract may decline in one trading day. Some markets close trading of contracts when the limit down is reached, others allow trading to resume if the price moves away from the day's limit. If there is a major event affecting the market's sentiment toward a particular commodity, it may take several trading days before the contract price fully reflects this change. On each trading day, the trading limit will be reached before the market's equilibrium contract price is met. \n\nLocked Limit\nOccurs when the trading price of a futures contract arrives at the exchange's predetermined limit price. At the lock limit, trades above or below the lock price are not executed. For example, if a futures contract has a lock limit of $5, as soon as the contract trades at $5 the contract would no longer be permitted to trade above this price if the market is on an uptrend, and the contract would no longer be permitted to trade below this price if the market is on a downtrend. The main reason for these limits is to prevent investors from substantial losses that can occur as a result of the volatility found in futures markets.\n\nThe Marking to Market Process\n\n\nAt the initiation of the trade, a price is set and money is deposited in the account. \n\nAt the end of the day, a settlement price is determined by the clearing house. The account is then adjusted accordingly, either in a positive or negative manner, with funds either being drawn from or added to the account based on the difference in the initial price and the settlement price. \n\nThe next day, the settlement price is used as the base price. \n\nAs the market prices change through the next day, a new settlement price will be determined at the end of the day. Again, the account will be adjusted by the difference in the new settlement price and the previous night's price in the appropriate manner. \n\n\nIf the account falls below the maintenance margin, the investor will be required to add additional funds into the account to keep the position open or allow it to be closed out. If the position is closed out the investor is still responsible for paying for his losses. This process continues until the position is closed out. \n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_347", "text": "\n\u00a0\nThis concept will be better explained by using an example to compute the margin balance. \nLet's start with a future's price of $200. The initial margin requirement is $10 and the maintenance margin is $6. The trader buy five contracts and deposits $50 (5 contacts x $10)\n\nDay 0 - The ending balance is $50.\nDay 1 - The price moves to $199.50. The adjustment that needs to be made is -$2.50 (200-199.5 x 5 contracts). The ending balance is now $47.50 ($50 - 2.50).

The clearing house views the trader as holding a long and short position that offset each other, causing the trader's position to be flat. This is the same as having no position at all.\nExample: Closing a Futures Position\nYou have entered a long position in 30 December S&P 250 contracts, in August. Come September, you decide that you want to close your position before the contract expires. To accomplish this, you must short, or sell the 30 December S&P 250 contract. The clearing house sees your position as flat because you are now long and short the same amount and type of contract.\nTerminating Futures Contracts\nClose-Out (offset) at Expiration - If a trader holds a long position, she can go short the same contract with regards to the terms of the original trade and vice versa for the short position trader. Prices may differ because of market conditions.\nDelivery - Here, the long position keeps the position open at the end of trading on the expiration date. This requires the long holder to accept delivery of the underlying asset and pay the short position the\u00a0Pre agreed\u00a0Future\u00a0price.\nEquivalent Cash Settlement - Some contracts are designated as cash-settle contracts. At expiration, the trader keeps his position open. When the contract expires, the margin account is marked to market and the gain is posted in the account. The reason that a gain is posted is because in most cases the trader would close out the position prior to expiration if it is a loser.\nExchange-for-Physicals - These are used for futures participants. Here the long and short holders arrange alternative delivery procedures. For example, if the exchange requires the physical delivery of the asset in Chicago, the parties may agree to make settlement outside of the required area, say Pittsburgh. The parties will have to report to the Chicago Board of Trade that the transaction was settled outside the normal procedures. This is satisfactory to the exchange.\n\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_349", "text": "\n\u00a0\nEurodollar Futures\nEurodollar futures work the same as T-bill contracts except the rate is based on LIBOR.\n\n\nPrice quotes and actual price is determined the in the same way as for T-bills.\n\nSettles in cash\n\nOne of most active contracts in the markets\n\nInstead of add-on interest, (for example a 100 @ 10% for a year and the bank would owe $110 dollars), the rate is subtracted from 100, just as it is with T-bills\n\nWith T-bills the investor would receive $1 million per contract, while in the Eurodollar futures market the firm would pay 1 million euros\n\nTreasury Bond Contracts\nA contract based on the delivery of a U.S. Treasury bond with any coupon and at least 15 years to maturity.\n\n\nThere are many different bonds that fit the above description.\n\nTo give some type of standardization, the markets use a conversion factor to achieve a hypothetical bond with a 6% coupon.\n\nBecause bond prices do not move in a linear fashion, there is a chance to use arbitrage to capitalize on the deviance of a bond when compared to the 6% standardized bond. To do this, traders look for the cheapest to deliver bond (CTD). This is the least expensive underlying product that can be delivered upon expiry to satisfy the requirements of a derivative contract. This helps minimize the slippage between the conversation factor and the actual price. \n\nThe CTD bond is always changing because prices and yields are always changing.\n\nA contract covers $100,000 par value of U.S. Treasuries.\n\nContract expires March, June, September and December\n\n\nStock Index Contracts\nInvestors trading index options are essentially betting on the overall movement of the stock market as represented by a basket of stocks.

For example if the S&P 500 is trading at 1050 the one-month contract may be at 1060.\n\nEach contract has a multiplier. For the S&P 500, it is 250. The actual price in the above point would equal 1060 x 250 = $265,000.\n\nS&P 500 contracts expire in March, June, September and December and can have maturity dates as far away as two years.\n\nSettlement is in cash.\n\nThe FTSE 100 and Japan's Nikkei 225 are other types of indexes upon which stock index contracts are based.\n\n\nCurrency Contracts\nCurrency contracts function in the same way as forward contracts for currency.\n\n\nThey are typically much smaller than forward contracts.\n\nEach contract has a stated size and quotation unit.\n\nFuture price for euros = 0.92, which leads to a contract price of 125,000(this is the contract size)(.92) = 115,000\n\nCalls for actual delivery through book entry of the underlying currency. \n\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_350", "text": "\nEuropean Option\nEuropean Options can only be exercised on the expiry date. European options are typically valued using the Black-Scholes or Black model formula. This is a simple equation with a closed-form solution that has become standard in the financial community. \n\nAmerican Option\nThis is an option that can be exercised at any time up to and including the expiry date. There are no general formulas for valuing American options, but a choice of models to approximate the price is available (for example Whaley, binomial options model, Monte Carlo and others), although there is no consensus on which is preferable.\n\nAmerican options are rarely exercised early. This is because all options have a non-negative time value and are usually worth more unexercised. Owners who wish to realize the full value of their options will mostly prefer to sell them rather than exercise them early and sacrifice some of the time value.\n\nNote that the names of these types of options are in no way related to Europe or the United States. \n\nMoneyness\nThe concept of moneyness describes whether an option is in-, out-, at-, or in-the-money by examining the position of strike vs. existing market price of the option's underlying security. \n\n\nIn the Money - Any option that has intrinsic value is in the money. A call option is said to be in the money when the futures price exceeds the option's strike price. A put is in the money when the futures price is below the option's strike price. For example, a March CME euro 90 call option will be in the money if March CME euro futures are above 90, meaning that the holder has the right to buy these futures at 90, regardless of how much the price has risen. The further in the money an option, the less time value it will have. \n\nDeep In the Money - These options represent a larger spread between the strike and market price of an underlying security. Options that are deep in the money generally trade at or near their actual intrinsic values, calculated by subtracting the strike price from the underlying asset's market price for a call option (and vice versa for a put option). This is because options with a significant amount of intrinsic value built in have a very low chance of expiring worthless. Therefore, the primary value they provide is already priced into the option in the form of their intrinsic value. As an option moves deeper into the money, the delta approaches 100% (for call options), which means for every point change in the underlying asset's price, there will be an equal and simultaneous change in the price of the option, in the same direction. Thus, investing in the option is similar to investing in the underlying asset, except the option holder will have the benefits of lower capital outlay, limited risk, leverage and greater profit potential. \n\nOut of the Money - These options exist when the strike price of a call (put) is above (below) the underlying asset's market price. (Essentially, it is the inverse of an in the money option). Options that are out of the money have a high risk of expiring worthless, but they tend to be relatively inexpensive. As the time value approaches zero at expiration, out of the money options have a greater potential for total loss if the underlying stock moves in an adverse direction.\n\nAt the Money - These options exist when the strike price of a call or put is equal to the underlying asset's market price. You can essentially think of at the money as the breakeven point (excluding transaction costs).\n\n\n\n\n\r\n\t\u00a0\n\nLook Out!\r\n\tNote that the above forms of moneyness do not take the cost of the option contract, or premium, into account.  \n\u00a0\n\n\nPayoff - Calculated by deducting the option premium paid from the intrinsic value of the option. In this case, an in-the-money option could produce a negative payoff if the premium is greater than the intrinsic value of the option. \n\nIntrinsic Value - Intrinsic value in options is the in-the-money portion of the option's premium. It is the value that any given option would have if it were exercised today. It is defined as the difference between the option's strike price (X) and the stock's actual current price (CP). In the case of a call option, you can calculate this intrinsic value by taking CP - X. If the result is greater than zero (in other words, if the stock's current price is greater than the option's strike price), then the amount left over after subtracting CP - X is the option's intrinsic value. If the strike price is greater than the current stock price, then the intrinsic value of the option is zero - it would not be worth anything if it were to be exercised today (please note that an option's intrinsic value can never be below zero). To determine the intrinsic value of a put option, simply reverse the calculation to X - CP.\n\nTime Value - The time value is any value of an option other than its intrinsic value. Time value is basically the risk premium that the seller requires to provide the option buyer with the right to buy or sell the stock up to the expiration date. While the actual calculation is complex, fundamentally, time value is related to a stock's beta or volatility. If the market does not expect the stock to move much (if it has a low beta), then the option's time value will be relatively low. Conversely, the option's time value will be high if the stock is expected to fluctuate significantly. \n\nTime value decreases as an option gets closer and closer to expiration. This is why options are considered \"wasting\" assets. As an option approaches expiration, the underlying stock has less and less time to move in a favorable direction for the option buyer; therefore, if you have two identical options - one that expires in six months and one expires in 12 months - the option that expires in 12 months will have greater time value because it has a better chance of moving higher. \n\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_351", "text": "\nOver the Counter OptionsMany derivative instruments such as forwards, swaps and most exotic derivatives are traded OTC.\n\nOTC Options are essentially unregulated\nAct like the forward market described earlier\nDealers offer to take either a long or short position in option and then hedge that risk with transactions in other options derivatives.\nBuyer faces credit risk because there is no clearing house and no guarantee that the seller will perform\nBuyers need to assess sellers' credit risk and may need collateral to reduce that risk.\nPrice, exercise price, time to expiration, identification of the underlying, settlement or delivery terms, size of contract, etc. are customized\nThe two counterparties determine terms. \n\nExchange-Traded OptionsAn option traded on a regulated exchange where the terms of each option are standardized by the exchange.

Financial Options: Financial options have financial assets, such as an interest rate or a currency, as their underlying assets. There are several types of financial options:\n\nStock Option - Also known as equity options, these are a privileges sold by one party to another. Stock options give the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy (call) or sell (put) a stock at an agreed-upon price during a certain period of time or on a specific date. \nIndex Option - A call or put option on a financial index, such as the Nasdaq or S&P 500. Investors trading index options are essentially betting on the overall movement of the stock market as represented by a basket of stocks.\nBond Option - An option contract in which the underlying asset is a bond. Other than the different characteristics of the underlying assets, there is no significant difference between stock and bond options. Just as with other options, a bond option allows investors to hedge the risk of their bond portfolios or speculate on the direction of bond prices with limited risk. A buyer of a bond call option is expecting a decline in interest rates and an increase in bond prices. The buyer of a put bond option is expecting an increase in interest rates and a decrease in bond prices.\nInterest Rate Option - Option in which the underlying asset is related to the change in an interest rate. Interest rate options are European-style, cash-settled options on the yield of U.S. Treasury securities. Interest rate options are options on the spot yield of U.S. Treasury securities. They include options on 13-week Treasury bills, options on the five-year Treasury note and options on the 10-year Treasury note. In general, the call buyer of an interest rate option expects interest rates will go up (as will the value of the call position), while the put buyer hopes rates will go down (increasing the value of the put position.) Interest rate options and other interest rate derivatives make up the largest portion of the worldwide derivatives market. It's estimated that $60 trillion dollars of interest rate derivatives contracts had been exchanged by May 2004. And, according to the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, 80% of the world's top 500 companies (as of April 2003) used interest rate derivatives to control their cash flow. This compares with 75% for foreign exchange options, 25% for commodity options and 10% for stock options.\nCurrency Option - A contract that grants the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell currency at a specified price during a specified period of time. Investors can hedge against foreign currency risk by purchasing a currency option put or call. \n"}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_352", "text": "\nA forward rate agreement (FRA) is an agreement between two parties to exchange a fixed interest payment for a floating interest payment. FRAs are OTC derivatives - forward contracts in which one party (which is referred to as the borrow or buyer) pays a fixed interest rate, and another party receives a floating interest rate equal to a reference rate (the underlying rate). The receiver is also referred to as the lender or seller. The payments are calculated over a notional amount over a certain period and netted - in other words, only the differential is paid on the termination date.\n\nInterest rate options give buyers the right, but not the obligation, to synthetically pay (in the case of a cap) or receive (in the case of a floor) a predetermined interest rate (the strike price) over an agreed period.\n\nSimilarities\n\n\nBoth Interest rate options and FRAs have interest rates as their underlyer. \n\nBoth use put or call formats. \n\nBoth use a notional amount to define the size of the trade.\n\nNeither requires an exchange of principal. \n\nDifferences\n\n\nAn FRA is a commitment to make one interest rate payment and receive another one at a future date while an option is the right to make one interest rate payment and receive another one. \n\nInterest rate options have exercise rate or strike rate instead of an exercise price like an FRA.\n\n\nOption Payoffs\nPayoffs for interest rate options function are similar to other options. The main difference is that the interest rate options take the days to maturity attached to the agreement into account. Also, the payoff from the option is not made until the end of the number of days attached to the rate. For example, if an interest rate option expires in 60 days and is based on 180-day LIBOR, the holder will not be paid for 180 days.\n\r\n\tInterest rate call option payoffs are determined by the following formula:\r\n\t\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nFormula 15.3\n \n\n\n\n\nInterest rate put option payoffs are determined by the following formula:\r\n\t\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nFormula 15.4\n \n\n\n\n\r\n\tNote that in each of the formulas above, the result of the equation is multiplied by the notional amount.\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_353", "text": "\nInterest Rate Cap\nAn interest rate cap is actually a series of European interest call options (called caplets), with a particular interest rate, each of which expire on the date the floating loan rate will be reset.

A common combination is straddles and strangles. These are option trading strategies that combine both puts and calls to create positions that do not depend on the direction of the market movement for their profitability. Long straddles and strangles make money if the stock price moves up or down significantly. \n\nA long straddle is long one call and long one put at the same strike price and expiration and on the same stock. A long strangle is long one call at a higher strike and long one put at a lower strike in the same expiration and on the same stock. Such a position makes money if the stock price moves up or down well past the strike prices of the strangle. There are higher costs and risk involved with these strategies, as we discuss below. \n\nStraddle\nAn options strategy where the investor holds a position in both a call and put with the same strike price and expiration date, but with different exercise prices. This strategy is illustrated in the following diagram.\r\n\t\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStraddles are a good strategy to pursue if an investor believes that a stock's price will move significantly, but is unsure as to which direction. The stock price must move significantly if the investor is to make a profit. As shown in the diagram above, should only a small movement in price occur in either direction, the investor will experience a loss. As a result, a straddle is extremely risky to perform. Additionally, on stocks that expected to jump, the market tends to price options at a higher premium, which ultimately reduces the expected payoff should the stock move significantly. \n\nStrangle\nAn options strategy where the investor holds a position in both a call and put with different strike prices but with the same maturity and underlying asset. This option strategy is profitable only if there are large movements in the price of the underlying asset.\n\r\n\tThis is a good strategy if you think there will be a large price movement in the near future but are unsure of the direction of that movement.\n\nThe strategy involves buying an out-of-the-money call and an out-of-the-money put option. A strangle is generally less expensive than a straddle as the contracts are purchased out of the money.\n\r\n\tFor example, imagine a stock currently trading at $50 a share. To employ the strangle option strategy a trader enters into two option positions, one call and one put. Suppose the call is for $55 and costs $300 ($3 per option x 100 shares) and the put is for $45 and costs $285 ($2.85 per option x 100 shares). If the price of the stock stays between $45 and $55 over the life of the option, the loss to the trader will be $585 (total cost of the two option contracts). The trader will make money if the price of the stock starts to move outside of the range. Suppose that the price of the stock ends up at $35. The call option will expire worthless and the loss will be $300 to the trader. The put option, however, has gained considerable value - it is worth $715 ($1,000 less the initial option value of $285).

One of the simplest formulas is as follows:\r\n\t\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nFormula 15.11\r\n\t\t\t\tc + PV(x) = p + s\n\nWhere:\nc = the current price or market value of the European call\nx = option strike price\nPV(x) = the present value of the strike price 'xeuropean' discounted from the expiration date at a suitable risk-free rate\np = the current price or market value of the European put\ns = the current market value of the underlyer\n\n\n\n\nThe put-call parity formula shows the relationship between the price of a put and the price of a call on the same underlying security with the same expiration date, which prevents arbitrage opportunities. A protective put (holding the stock and buying a put) will deliver the exact payoff as a fiduciary call (buying one call and investing the present value (PV) of the exercise price). \r\n\t\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nNote: There are much more sophisticated formulas for analyzing put-call relationships. For the exam, you should know that a protective put = fiduciary call (asset + put = call + cash).\n\n\n\n\nPortfolio insurance is very similar to a \"fiduciary call\" (lending + call). The amount of lending is set so that return of principal plus interest by the payoff date exactly equals the floor. \n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_358", "text": "\nAt any given point in time, the value of a call option or a put option cannot exceed a particular price. Option prices fluctuate between their upper and lower bounds. For example, a call option can never be worth more than the stock price; therefore, the value of a call option should be lower or equal to the stock price. If there is a violation of this rule, arbitrageurs will enter and make a riskless profit by buying the stock and selling the call option. \n\nIn the case of a put option, the upper bound is the strike price at which the contract has been entered. The value of a put will be lower than or (at most) equal to the strike price of the option. If this condition is violated, an investor can make use of the arbitrage opportunity by writing the option and investing the proceeds at the risk-free rate of interest. \n\nAs explained earlier, the lower bounds for an American call option are the same as the lower bounds for a European call option. Prices of American and European options differ mainly in whether they can be exercised before expiration, as is the case with American calls. As such, in most cases American calls and puts will be worth more than European calls and puts and their lower bounds will also differ.\n\n\nWhen the underlying asset does not make cash payments such as dividends or interest payments, the value of an American call option is equal to a European call option.\n\nWhen cash payments are involved, the value of an American call option tends to be higher than a European call option.\n\nAmerican put options are almost always worth more than European put options.\n\nTo take into account cash flows on underlying assets, we must rewrite the maximum value formulas (for European options given above) as follows: \n\nEuropean Options:\nFormula 15.12\n\n\nWhere: C = Call, S = Strike price, PV = Present value, CF = Cash Flow,\r\n\tr = interest rate, T= Time to expiration of the option \n\nCash flows for underlying assets are as follows:\n\n\nStocks pay dividends - in formula terms FV (D,O,T) or PV (D,O,T)\n\nBonds pay interest - in formula terms FV (CI,O,T) or PV (CI,O,T)\n\nCurrency pays interest\n\nCommodities have carrying costs\n\nThe underlying price is reduced by the PV of the cash flows of the underlying; therefore, the put-call parity relationship is calculated as:\nFormula 15.13\n \nThis formula determines the reduction in the price of the underlying assets as related to the present value of the cash flows over the life of the trade.\n\nInterest Rate Changes and Option Prices\nOptions are priced on a risk-neutral basis, so a long call (for example) would be paired with a short stock. A short-stock position generates interest revenue, which makes the call option more valuable. If interest rates go up, the interest revenue from the short stock position increases, which makes the call worth even more. For put options and dividends, it works in the opposite direction.\n\nWhen interest rates are high, the prices of calls are higher and the prices of puts are lower. Why? When buying an option, one is essentially using leverage. When rates are high, the option itself is more attractive than the underlying asset. By purchasing an option instead of the underlying asset, an investor saves cash.  \n\nPuts are adversely affected by higher rates because investors lose interest while waiting to sell their underlying assets. This works for all underlying assets except when dealing with bonds or interest rates.\n\nInterest rate volatility has a huge effect on option prices. When volatility increases, call and put prices both increase because of the increased possibility that a downside or upside event could occur concerning the option. The upside helps call price and has no effect on puts, while downside helps puts with no effect on calls and is especially true when options are out of the money. Downside does begin to matter when options become in the money.\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_359", "text": "\nSwaps are non-standardized contracts that are traded over the counter (OTC). However, to facilitate trading, market participants have developed the ISDA Master Agreement, which covers the 'non-economic' terms of a swap contract, such as representations and warranties, events of default and termination events. Parties to the trade still need to negotiate the rate or price, notional amount, maturity, collateral, etc. \n\nSwaps are contracts that exchange assets, liabilities, currencies, securities, equity participations and commodities. Some are simple, such as floating-for-fixed-rate loans or Japanese yen for British pound sterling, while others are quite complex incorporating multiple currencies, interest rates, commodities and options. Both types are flexible in terms of specifications such as pricing or evaluation benchmarks, timing or contractual horizons, settlement procedures, resets, and other variables.\n\nGenerally, swaps are used for risk management by institutions such as banks, brokers, dealers and corporations. Some qualified individuals may also be suitable users of these basic derivatives products. The following lists highlight common swaps transactions.\n\n\nCommodities: agricultural, energy, metals\n\nCurrencies: amortization or amortizing, differential, forward rates, forward start \n\nEquities: basket, differential or spread, indexed, individual security related \n\nInterest Rates: amortization or amortizing, arrears, basis, fixed for floating, forward start, inverse floater, zero coupon\n\nSwap Characteristics\n\n\nMost involve multiple payments, although one-payment contracts are possible\n\nA series of forward contracts.\n\nWhen initiated, neither party exchanges any cash; a swap has zero value at the beginning.\n\nOne party tends to pay a fixed rate while the other pays on the movement of the underlying asset. However, a swap can be structured so that both parties pay each other on the movement of an underlying asset.\n\nParties make payments to each other on a settlement date. Parties may decide to agree to just exchange the difference that is due to each other. This is called netting. \n\nFinal payment is made on the termination date.\n\nUsually traded in the over-the-counter market. This means they are subject credit risk.\n\nTerminating a Swap Contract\nThe easiest way to terminate the contract is to hold it to maturity. However, if one or both parties in a swap contract wish to terminate, there are several methods:\n\n\nEnter into a separate and offsetting swap. For example, an entity has a swap on its books that pays a fixed rate and receives a floating rate based on LIBOR on January 1 and July 1. The entity can enter into a new swap that pays a floating rate based on LIBOR and receives a fixed rate with payments on January 1 and July 1. With this new transaction, your fixed rates may be different because of market rates, while the LIBOR payments will wash out over the transaction's life. Credit risk will also increase because you could have a new counterparty for the new swap.\n\nThe other way is to have a cash settlement based on market value. For example, assume that a party holds a swap with a market value of $65,000. The contract could be terminated if the other party pays the market value of the contract to the holder. Said another way, if the party holding the swap has a negative value, it can terminate the swap by paying its counterparty the market value of the swap. This terminates the contract for both parties, but this is usually available only if it is stated before the contract is entered into or agree upon by both parties at a later date.\n\nAnother way to terminate a swap is to sell the swap to another party. This usually requires permission from the other party. This is not commonly used in the market place.\n\nThe last way to terminate a contract is to use a swaption. A swaption works like an option by giving the owner the right to enter into another swap at terms that are set in advance. By executing the swaption, the party can offset its current swap as explained in the first way to terminate a contract.\n\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_360", "text": "\nLike an interest rate swap, a currency swap is a contract to exchange cash flow streams from some fixed income obligations (for example, swapping payments from a fixed-rate loan for payments from a floating rate loan). In an interest rate swap, the cash flow streams are in the same currency, while in currency swaps, the cash flows are in different monetary denominations. Swap transactions are not usually disclosed on corporate balance sheets. \n\nAs we stated earlier, the cash flows from an interest rate swap occur on concurrent dates and are netted against one another. With a currency swap, the cash flows are in different currencies, so they can't net. Instead, full principal and interest payments are exchanged. \n\nCurrency swaps allow an institution to take leverage advantages it might enjoy in specific countries. For example, a highly-regarded German corporation with an excellent credit rating can likely issue euro-denominated bonds at an attractive rate. It can then swap those bonds into, say, Japanese yen at better terms than it could by going directly into the Japanese market where its name and credit rating may not be as advantageous. \n\nAt the origination of a swap agreement, the counterparties exchange notional principals in the two currencies. During the life of the swap, each party pays interest (in the currency of the principal received) to the other. At maturity, each makes a final exchange (at the same spot rate) of the initial principal amounts, thereby reversing the initial exchange. Generally, each party in the agreement has a comparative advantage over the other with respect to fixed or floating rates for a certain currency. A typical structure of a fixed-for-floating currency swap is as follows:\r\n\t\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCalculating the Payments on a Currency Swap\nLet's consider an example:\n\r\n\tFirm A can borrow Canadian currency at a rate of 10% or can borrow U.S. currency at a floating rate equal to six-month LIBOR. Firm B can borrow Canadian currency at a rate of 11% or U.S. currency at a rate of floating rate equal to six-month LIBOR. Although Firm A can borrow Canadian currency at a cheaper rate than Firm B, it needs a floating-rate loan. Additionally, Firm B needs a fixed-rate Canadian dollar loan. The loan is for US$20 million, and will mature in two years.\n\nWho has the comparative advantage?\nTo determine who has the comparative advantage, consider the fixed rates for each firm for the currency required. In this case, Firm A's rate of 10% is less than Firm B's rate of 11%, so Firm A has a comparative advantage in the fixed currency. That leaves Firm B to have a comparative advantage with respect to the floating rate.\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_361", "text": "\nPlain Vanilla Interest Rate Swap\nIn general, an interest rate swap is an agreement to exchange rate cash flows from interest-bearing instruments at specified payment dates. Each party's payment obligation is computed using a different interest rate. Although there are no truly standardized swaps, a plain vanilla swap typically refers to a generic interest rate swap in which one party pays a fixed rate and one party pays a floating rate (usually LIBOR).\n\nFor each party, the value of an interest rate swap lies in the net difference between the present value of the cash flows one party expects to receive and the present value of the payments the other party expects to make. At the origination of the contract, the value for both parties is usually zero because no cash flows are exchanged at that point. Over the life of the contract, it becomes a zero-sum game. As interest rates fluctuate, the value of the swap creates a profit on one counterparty's books, which results in a corresponding loss on the other's books.\n\nExample\nA portfolio manager with a $1 million fixed-rate portfolio yielding 3.5% believes rates may increase and wants to decrease his exposure. He can enter into an interest rate swap and trade his fixed rate cash flows for floating rate cash flows that have less exposure when rates are rising. He swaps his 3.5% fixed-rate interest stream for the three-month floating LIBOR rate (which is currently at 3%). When this happens, he will receive a floating rate payment and pay a fixed rate that is equivalent to the rate the portfolio is receiving, making his portfolio a floating-rate portfolio instead of the fixed-rate return he was receiving. There is no exchange of the principal amounts and the interest payments are netted against one another. For example, if LIBOR is 3%, the manager receives 0.5%. The actual amounts calculated for semiannual payments are shown below. The fixed rate (3.5% in this example) is referred to as the swap rate.\n\nA typical exam question concerning interest rate swaps follows:\n\n\nQ. Two parties enter a three-year, plain-vanilla interest rate swap agreement to exchange the LIBOR rate for a 10% fixed rate on $10 million. LIBOR is 11% now, 12% at the end of the first year, and 9% at the end of the second year. If payments are in arrears, which of the following characterizes the net cash flow to be received by the fixed-rate payer?\n\n\nA. $100,000 at the end of year two.\nB. $100,000 at the end of year three.\nC. $200,000 at the end of year two.\nD. $200,000 at the end of year three.\n\nA. The correct answer is \"C\". What's important to remember is that the payments are in arrears, so the end-of-year payments depend on the interest rate at the beginning of the year (or prior year end). The payment at the end of year two is based on the 12% interest rate at the end of year one. If the floating rate is higher than the fixed rate, the fixed rate payer receives the interest rate differential times the principal amount ($10,000 x (0.12-0.10) = $200,000).\n\nCalculate the Payments on an Interest Rate Swap\nConsider the following example:\n\nNotional amount = $1 million, payments are made semiannually. The corporation will pay a floating rate of three-month LIBOR, which is at 3% and will receive a fixed payment of 3.5%.\n\nAnswer:\nFloating rate payment is $1 million(.03)(180/365) = $14,790\nFixed payment is $1 million(.035)(180/365) = $17,225\n\nThe corporation will receive a net payment of $2,435.\n\nEquity Swaps\nAn equity swap is an agreement between counterparties to exchange a set of payments, determined by a stock or index return, with another set of payments (usually an interest-bearing (fixed or floating rate) instrument, but they can also be the return on another stock or index). Equity swaps are used to substitute for a direct transaction in stock. The two cash flows are usually referred to as \"legs\". As with interest rate swaps, the difference in the payment streams is netted. \n\nEquity swaps have many applications. For example, a portfolio manager with XYZ Fund can swap the fund's returns for the returns of the S&P 500 (capital gains, dividends and income distributions.) They most often occur when a manager of a fixed income portfolio wants the portfolio to have exposure to the equity markets either as a hedge or a position. The portfolio manager would enter into a swap in which he would receive the return of the S&P 500 and pay the counterparty a fixed rate generated form his portfolio. The payment the manager receives will be equal to the amount he is receiving in fixed-income payments, so the manager's net exposure is solely to the S&P 500. These types of swaps are usually inexpensive and require little in term of administration. \n\nFor individuals, equity swaps offer some tax advantages. The owner of $1 million worth of XYZ stock watches his stock value increase by 25% over 12 months. He wants to take some of the profit but does not want to actually sell his shares. In this case, he can enter into an equity swap in which he pays a counterparty (perhaps his brokerage) the total return he receives from his XYZ shares annually for the next three years. In return, he'll take the three-month LIBOR rate. In this scenario, the owner of XYZ does not have to report any capital gains on his stock and retains ownership of those stocks as well. \n\n\nA total return equity swaps includes capital gains and dividends paid on the underlying stock or stock index. No principal is exchanged and payments are set off by a notional amount.\n\n\nCalculate the Payments on an Equity Swap\nConsider the following example:\n\nNotional principal amount = $1 million\nPayments made semi-annual\nFund manager will pay the broker/dealer the return of the S&P 500 and will receive an interest payment of 5% every six months\nIndex is at 10,500 at the start of the swap\n\nResults:\nSix months from now the index is at 11,000.\n\n\nThe fixed payment the fund will receive is:\r\n\t\t$1 million(0.05) 182/365 = $24,931.51\n\nThe index payment the fund must make is:\r\n\t\t(11,000/10,500 -1) $1 million = $47,619.04\n\n\nThe net payment the fund must make at the end of the first six months is $22,687.50 (47,619.04 - 24,931.51).\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_362", "text": "\nLet's look at a typical long call. Let's say it is 1 MNO May 100 call @ 3; essentially the spot rate for the stock has to rise above $103 ($100 strike price plus $3 premium) to be in the money. In fact, the option begins life at $3 out of the money because of the premium.\r\n\t\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis graph reflects the point of view of the buyer.

This is different from the payoff. To figure the payoff, simply assume the premium equals $0.\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_363", "text": "\n\nCovered Call and Protective Put Strategies\nThere is one more way for options to be classified:\n\n\nCovered\n\nUncovered, or naked\n\nWhether a contract is covered or uncovered has a great deal to do with the margin, or credit, required of the parties involved.\n\nCovered Call\nA covered call is when the investor has a long position in an asset combined with a short position in a call option on the same underlying asset. A call writer may be required to deliver the stock if the buyer exercises his option. If the call writer has the shares on deposit with her broker, then she has written a covered call. There is no margin requirement for a covered call; this is because the underlying securities are sitting right there - there is no question of creditworthiness.\n\r\n\tAn investor will write a call option when he feels that a particular stock's price will not rise above a certain level. Note that if the call option is exercised in the money, the call writer will sell the call option holder's stock from his inventory at the strike price indicated in the option contract. His maximum loss would then be:\n\r\n\tMaximum loss = Call Premium + Exercise Price - Price Paid for underlying asset.\n\r\n\tLet's look at an example. Suppose that you have 250 shares of XYZ that you bought for $17 and that the XYZ Jul 20 call option trades for $1. \n\nThe following diagram illustrates the typical payoff to expect from a covered call.\r\n\t\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUncovered Call\nIf the call writer does not have the underlying shares on deposit, she has written an uncovered call, which is much riskier for the writer than a covered call. If the buyer of a call exercises the option to call, the writer will be forced to buy the asset at the spot price and, since there is no limit to how high a share price can go, that spot price can theoretically go up to an infinite amount of dollars. \n\nProtective Put\nA protective put is an option in which the writer has cash on deposit equal to the cost to purchase the shares from the holder of the put if the holder exercises his right to sell. This limits the writer's risk because money or stock is already set aside.\n\nThe risk, however, is not that great. The stock is not going to be purchased at the spot price; it is going to be purchased at the exercise price, which was agreed to the day of the opening transaction. The higher the spot price goes, the more the writer benefits because she buys the stock at the lower exercise price and sells it for whatever she can get in the market. There is a risk that the spot price will go down, but the lowest it can go is $0 and that almost never happens in the span of time covered by an options contract.\n\nLet's consider the worst-case scenario in which the writer has to pay the full exercise price for a completely worthless stock. If she sold a put at $18 and it is now worth nothing, then she has lost $18 for each share she pledged to buy: if that was a block of 50,000 shares, the loss amounts to $900,000. Nobody wants to lose that kind of money, but it is insignificant compared to the astronomical losses possible with writing uncovered calls.\n\nExample: Say ABC stock trades for $75 and its one-month $70 puts trade for $3. A put writer would sell the $70 puts in the market and collect the $300 [$3 x 100] premium. Such a trader expects the price of ABC to trade above $67 in the coming month, as represented below:\r\n\t\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThus, we see that the trader is exposed to increasing losses as the price of the stock falls below $67. For example, at a share price of $65, the put seller is still obligated to buy shares of ABC at the strike price of $70. \n\nHe or she would face a loss of $200, which is calculated as the following: \n\n$6,500 (market value) - $7,000 (price paid) + $300 (premium collected)\n\nUncovered Put\nThe difference in the risk profiles between uncovered calls (nearly limitless risk) and an uncovered put (clearly defined risk) is why conservative investors who would never think of writing an uncovered call will not hesitate to write an uncovered put. An uncovered put is a short position in which the writer does not have cash on deposit equal to the cost to purchase the shares from the holder of the put if the holder exercises his right to sell. Again, the writer knows, to the dollar, exactly what the worst-case scenario is and can make an informed decision about whether or not it is worth tying up capital to cover the put.\n\nCONCLUSION\nWithin this section, we've learned about derivatives, forwards, futures, options and swap markets, the characteristics of the various types of derivatives, determining payoffs of various strategies and positions, and how to apply option strategies to manage risk.\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_364", "text": "\nThe Alternative Investments section acts as the catch-all for all of the areas of the CFA exam that have not been previously discussed in detail by the early learning outcome statements.

It is an investment company that sells a fixed number of shares at a one-time initial public offering. Shares are not continuously offered for sale; after the public offering, the shares typically can be bought and sold only on a formal exchange such as the New York Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq. Closed-end funds come in many varieties. The investment strategies, risk tolerance, return objectives and overall investment portfolios of closed-end funds vary across a broad spectrum. The investment portfolios are actively managed by investment advisers.\nOnce closed-end fund shares begin to trade, their prices are determined by supply and demand and not by net-asset value (NAV); therefore, the market price may be greater or less than the shares' NAV. Generally, a closed-end fund is not required to buy its shares back from investors upon request. However, some closed-end funds, commonly referred to as interval funds, offer to repurchase their shares at specified intervals.\nOne of the significant differences between closed-end funds and mutual funds is that closed-end funds are allowed to invest in a greater amount of \"illiquid\" securities. (By \"illiquid\" we mean securities that can't be sold within a reasonable period of time - usually seven days - at the approximate price used by the fund in determining NAV.)\nMost mutual funds are open-end funds but closed-end funds are subject to similar SEC registration and regulation requirements, and are subject to numerous requirements imposed for the protection of investors. Closed-end funds are regulated under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and are also subject to the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\nAlthough less popular than their open-ended counterparts, these investment vehicles are worth a second look. For more on these types of funds, review the following article: Open Your Eyes To Closed-End Funds.\nOpen-End Fund\nIn simple terms, an open-end mutual fund is when a company aggregates money from many investors and invests the money in stocks, bonds, short-term money-market instruments or other securities. Investors purchase mutual fund shares directly from the fund itself at a price that is determined by the fund's per-share net asset value (NAV) plus any shareholder fees that the fund imposes at purchase (such as sales loads). Mutual fund shares are \"redeemable\": when the holder of the mutual fund shares wants to sell those shares, he or she sells them back to the fund (or to a broker acting for the fund) at their approximate NAV minus any fees the fund imposes at that time (such as deferred sales loads or redemption fees). Open-end fund shares cannot be bought or sold in secondary markets, such as the New York Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq.\nIn most cases, mutual funds sell their shares continually to investors. However, there are circumstances where the investment adviser may close the fund to new investors - usually when it's decided that the fund has become too large to manage effectively. Like closed-end funds, the investment portfolios of open-end mutual funds vary broadly across many investment styles, return objectives, investment strategies and risk tolerance.\nThe fees charged by mutual funds can significantly impact total return and should be carefully assessed by investors. All funds charge investors some level of management fees for operating the fund. Some also pass on their distribution and service costs, commonly referred to as \"12b-1\" fees. In addition, \"load\" funds impose a sales charge when the shares are purchased (front load) or sold (back load). To cater to a wide variety of investors, funds may create a number of different \"classes\" of shares, with each class having different fees and expenses. Finally, some funds calculate sales charges based on the investment amount with larger investments incurring smaller fees (or eliminating the fee altogether). These investment threshold levels, known as breakpoints, are important features for investors.\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_366", "text": "\nCalculating the Net Asset Value of a FundNet asset value (NAV)is significant only for open-end mutual funds. It is a simple calculation - just take the current market value of the fund's net assets (securities held by the fund minus any liabilities) and divide by the number of shares outstanding. Thus, if a fund has total net assets of $50 million and there are one million shares of the fund, then the NAV is $50 per share. (Fund liabilities include items such as fees owed to investment managers.) For closed-end funds, share value is determined in the secondary markets (the formal exchanges) where the shares are traded. The NAV of a closed-end fund is the price per share multiplied by the total number of shares. Obviously, the value of a closed-end mutual fund changes continuously throughout the trading day. For open-end mutual funds, NAV is a useful determinant for tracing share price movements. However, it is not useful for evaluating overall fund performance. This is because mutual funds are required by law to distribute at least 90% of their realized capital gains and dividend income to investors each year. When a fund pays investors the required distribution, its NAV is reduced by the amount of the distribution. Investors tracking only NAV may become concerned about the drop but in fact, the net value of their investment is unchanged; the reduction in NAV is offset by the amount of distribution they have been paid. The most important thing to keep in mind is that NAVs change daily and are not a good indicator of actual performance because of the impact yearly distributions have on NAV (it also makes mutual funds hard to track).\n\n\nLook Out!The NAV is usually below the market price because the current value of the fund\\'s assets is higher than the historical financial statements used in the NAV calculation.\n\n\n\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_367", "text": "\nFees Charged by Investment CompaniesInvestment companies charge investors a wide assortment of fees. Mutual funds that are just coming to market, for example, may set the price for the initial sale of shares slightly higher than the shares' NAV to help defray start-up costs. Sales Fees:Frequently, funds charge some sort of sales fee or \"load\". A front-end load is a sales commission charged to investors when the shares are purchased. A back-end load, or redemption fee,is charged to investors when theysell shares and exit the fund. Ostensibly, these fees help reduce the frequency of trading in and out of the fund and encourage investors to maintain their positions. Although these are one-time charges, it makes sense to look at them in terms of an investor's time horizon. So, for example, a front load fee of 4.8% on a $10,000 share purchase ($480) translates to a per-year cost of $160 when an investor holds the shares for only three years ($480/3). If the investor holds the shares for 10 years, however, his cost per year is only $48. To make fee comparisons easy, services such as Morningstar calculate the cost of buying and holding $10,000 of a fund's shares over three-, five- and 10-year time horizons. Sales commissions provide an incentive to the sales force but they can seriously impact investors' total return. Funds also charge annual fees to cover operating expenses, management and distribution costs. \n\nManagement fees are fixed fees that a mutual fund manager charges investors for her services and work with the fund. They are usually categorized as administrative fees or management fees.\n12B-1 fees allow a mutual fund to collect a small fee from investors. This fee is designated for promotions, sales, or any other activity connected with the distribution of the fund's shares. The fee must be reasonable: 0.5% to 1% of the fund's net assets and up to a maximum of 8.5% of the offering price per share. \n\nIn choosing between two funds with similar features and performance, the fund with the lowest total fees will always be more appealing to investors. One way to compare fees is to look at the fund's expense ratio. This is presented in the annual report as well as in the prospectus. Average fees vary according to asset class: bond funds typically have a lower expense ratio than U.S. stock funds which, in turn, generally charge less than international stock funds.\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_368", "text": "\nStyle Strategy Stock selection for individual investors can be a daunting task. Choosing securities from the global marketplace, analyzing, evaluating, purchasing and tracking performance of those securities within a diversified portfolio is not something most individual non-professional investors are able or willing to do. Instead, investors can make portfolio allocation decisions by choosing among broad categories of securities, such as \"large-cap\", \"growth\", \"international\" or \"emerging markets\". This approach to investing - looking at the underlying characteristics common to certain types of investments - is termed style investing.   The popularity of style investing increased considerably for institutional investors during the 1980s as the pension consulting community encouraged clients to categorize equity styles during the asset allocation process. Both institutional and individual investors found that categorizing stocks by style simplifies investor choices and allows them to process information about stocks within a category more easily and more efficiently. Allocating savings across a limited number of investment styles is a far easier and much less intimidating task than choosing among thousands of investment options available throughout the world.     By classifying assets according to a specific style, investors are also better able to evaluate the performance of professional money managers. In other words, all the money mangers handling emerging growth stock funds can be ranked by performance in that particular category. In fact, money managers are generally evaluated not in terms of absolute performance but relative to a performance benchmark for their style of investing.    Over the past decade, a new set of sub-styles, in addition to the usual styles of value and growth, has been accepted by the investment community. These are: deep and relative value and disciplined and aggressive growth.   Value style managers look for stocks that are incorrectly priced given the issuer's exiting assets and earnings. They employ traditional valuation measures that equate a stock's price to the company's intrinsic value. Value companies tend to have relatively low price/earnings ratios, pay higher dividends and have historically more stable stock prices. The value manager's basic assumption is that the issuer's worth will, at some point, be revalued and thereby generate gains for the money manager. There are several reasons that a stock might be undervalued: the company may be so small that the stock is thinly traded and doesn't attract much interest; the company is operating in an unpopular industry; the corporate structure is complicated, making analysis difficult or the stock price may not have fully reacted to positive new developments. Value stocks are typically found in slower-growing sectors of the economy like finance and basic industry but there are bargains to be found even in \"growth\" sectors such as technology.   During the 1990s, Standard & Poor's identified three specific sub-styles: deep value, relative value and new value.   \n\nDeep Value style uses the traditional Graham and Dodd approach whereby managers buy the cheapest stocks and hold them for long periods in anticipation of a market upswing.     \nRelative Value money managers seek out stocks that are under-appreciated relative to the market, their peer group, and the company's earnings potential. Relative value stocks should also feature some sort of channel (such as a patent or pending FDA approval) that has the potential to unlock the stock's real value. A typical holding period is three to five years. Unlike traditional value managers, relative value managers pursue opportunities across all economic sectors and may not concentrate on the usual \"value sectors\".   \nNew value managers choose their investments from all securities categories, seeking any stock that holds prospect for significant appreciation.  \n\nGrowth style managers typically focus on an issuer's future earnings potential. They try to identify stocks offering the potential for growing earnings at above-average rates. Where value managers look at current earnings and assets, growth managers look to the issuer's future earnings power. Growth is generally associated with greater upside potential relative to style investing and, of course, it has concomitant greater downside risk.    \n\nTraditional growth style investing has also spawned a few sub styles, specifically, disciplined growth or growth-at-a reasonable-price (GARP), and aggressive, or momentum, growth.\nDisciplined growth style managers concentrate on companies that they believe can grow their earnings at a rate higher than the market average and that are selling for an appropriate price.\nAggressive growth styles tend not to rely on traditional valuation methods or fundamental analysis. They rely on technical analysis.    \n\nSector Strategy Look at a particular industry such as transportation. Because the holdings of this type of fund are in the same industry, there is an inherent lack of diversification associated with these funds. These funds tend to increase substantially in price when there is an increased demand for the product or service offering provided by the businesses in which the funds invest. On the other hand, if there is a downturn in the specific sector in which a sector fund invests, the fund will face heavy losses due to the lack of diversification in its holdings.   Index Strategy Tends to track the index it follows by purchasing the same weights and types of securities in that index, such as an S&P fund. Investing in an index fund is a form of passive investing. The primary advantage to such a strategy is the lower management expense ratio on an index fund. Also, a majority of mutual funds fail to beat broad indexes such as the S&P 500.   If you can't beat the market, why not join it? We go over your options in the following article: The Lowdown On Index Funds.   Global Strategy A global strategist builds a diversified portfolio of securities from any country throughout the globe (Not to be confused with an international strategy, which may include securities from every other country except the fund's home country.) Global money managers may further concentrate on a particular style or sector or they may choose to allocate investment capital in the same weightings as world market capitalization weights.   Stable Value Strategy The stable value investment style is a conservative fixed income investment strategy. A stable value investment manager seeks short-term fixed income securities and guaranteed investment contracts issued by insurance companies. These funds are attractive to investors who want high current income and protection from price volatility caused by movements in interest rates.     Dollar-Cost Averaging Dollar-cost averaging is a straightforward, traditional investing methodology. Dollar-cost averaging is implemented when an investor commits to investing a fixed dollar amount on a regular basis, usually monthly purchase of shares in a mutual fund. When the fund's price declines, the investor can buy a greater number of shares for the fixed investment amount, and a lesser number when the share price is moves up. This strategy results in lowering the average cost slightly, assuming the fund fluctuates up and down.   Value Averaging This is a strategy in which an investor adjusts the amount invested, up or down, to meet a prescribed target. An example should clarify: Suppose you are going to invest $200 per month in a mutual fund. At the end of the first month, thanks to a decline in the fund's value, your initial $200 investment has declined to $190. In this case, you would contribute $210 the following month, bringing the value to $400 (2*$200). Similarly, if the fund is worth $430 at the end of the second month, you only put in $170 to bring it up to the $600 target. What happens is that compared to dollar cost averaging, you put in more when prices are down, and less when prices are up.\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_369", "text": "\nExchange-traded funds (ETFs) are investment companies that are technically classified as open-end companies (although they are not considered to be or allowed to call themselves mutual funds). These are index funds that mirror the composition of standard indexes such as the NASDAQ 100 or the Russell 2000; it may also include broad market, sectors, single countries or regions as well as fixed income. They allow investors to buy or sell exposure to an index through a single financial instrument. They are like traditional funds in that they are a pool of money to be invested, however, unlike traditional funds, ETFs can be sold short or margined in the investor's account. ETFs also differ from traditional open-end companies because ETF shares trade on a secondary market (as do closed-end funds) and are only redeemable in very large blocks (50,000 shares for example). \nRelatively new and somewhat less intuitive than other investment companies, ETFs are actually certificates that grant ownership over part of a basket of individual stocks. ETFs trade at prices that closely match their underlying assets and unwind when investors no longer want them. Fund Managers are vital to the process: they must develop a plan for operating the ETF and have the plan approved by the SEC. The ETF plan must explain the ETF's composition, identify other firms involved in the fund and describe how the fund will operate and how redemption will occur. \nETF Managers\nThe fund manager instructs pension funds, which control huge securities portfolios, to loan the stocks necessary for creating the ETF index of stocks. (The pension funds get a small amount of interest in return.) Today, the role of ETF manager is usually left to the very largest institutional money management firms with experience in indexing. The fund manager takes a small portion of the fund's annual assets as their fee. An authorized participant, also referred to as a market maker or specialist, assembles the appropriate basket of stocks and sends them to a custodial bank. The custodial bank is responsible for ensuring that the basket does, in fact, mirror the requested ETF. It forwards the ETF shares on to the authorized participant. The custodial bank holds the basket of stocks in the fund's account for the fund manager to monitor. \nThe Depository Trust Clearing Corp., the same U.S. government agency that records individual stock sales and keeps the official records of these transactions, records ETF transfers of title just like with any stock. It provides an extra layer of assurance against fraud.\nOnce the authorized participant obtains the ETF from the custodial bank, it is free to sell it in the open market. From then on, ETF shares are sold and resold freely among investors on the open market. The authorized participant derives a profit from the difference in price between the basket of stocks and the ETF and on part of the bid-ask spread of the ETF itself.\nRedeeming ETFs\nTo effect a redemption, an authorized participant buys a large block of ETFs on the open market and sends it to the custodial bank. In return, the participant gets back an equivalent basket of individual stocks, which are then sold on the open market or returned to the pension funds that originally owned them. Competition tends to keep ETF prices very close to their underlying net asset value (the value of component stocks). \nFor further reading on exchange traded funds, refer to our Introduction to Exchange-Traded Funds article.\n\nAdvantages and Risks of ETFs\nETFs differ from traditional mutual funds in a number of ways. \n\u00a0\nTrading: Buy and sell orders for traditional mutual funds are taken throughout the trading day but the transactions actually occur at the close of the market. It's at that point that the NAV is calculated (The sum of the closing day prices of all the stocks contained in the fund is divided by the number of shares in the fund.) ETFs trade continuously and allow an investor to lock in a price for the underlying stocks immediately.\nFees: ETFs are economical to buy compared to most mutual funds. Annual fees are as low as .09% of assets compared to the average mutual fund fees of 1.4%. Discount brokerage options mitigate the transaction costs associated with trading ETFs. They can be margined and options based on them allow for various defensive (or speculative) investing strategies.\nSafety: The risk and safety associated with ETFs is considered to be equivalent to the risk and safety of the stock certificates themselves. \n\nAdvantages:\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAllows investors to diversify very easily by buying or selling the shares. As mentioned earlier, an ETF can cover an index no matter how big or small that index is.\nThey trade on an exchange and can be sold short or margined.\nETFs trade throughout whole day, so prices are always updated, while mutual funds only have a price at the close of the day.\nTrading futures and options on ETFs helps manage the risk involved in trading ETFs.\nETF holdings are transparent. The sponsor posts the fund's holdings daily, which should mimic the index, while a mutual fund may disclose the fund's portfolio composition only on a yearly basis.\nThey are cost effective, don't charge load fees and are passively managed, while mutual funds may have substantial fees and are often actively measured, which increases the expense ratio compared to ETFs.\nTheir structure prevents any type of premium or discount forming because of the arbitrage effect of the futures and options on these securities. A closed-end fund, on the other hand, has a limited amount of shares, which can cause it to become overpriced as a result of its supply and demand attributes.\nETFs mitigate capital gains exposure.\nDividends are reinvested immediately for open-end ETFs.\n\nDisadvantages/Risks:\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIn many countries, the basket of securities that the ETF tracks may be limited.\nMany investors do not need the intraday trading activity of the security.\nBid/ask spreads may be large because of the light trading that may occur in specific ETFs.\nDue to their size, large institutions may want to invest directly in the index or actively invest in the index, which could lead to lower cost and a better tax situation.\n\nThe following article provides further details about the advantages to ETFs: Advantages of Exchange-Traded Funds.\n\u00a0\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_370", "text": "\nWhat is Real Estate?\n\nIt is a tangible asset.\nIt is an immovable asset. Each real estate asset is a unique investment because of the property and buildings that can be built on it.\nReal estate can be very illiquid if the land and buildings are purchased outright. On the other hand, investors can enjoy higher liquidity if the same asset (either land or buildings) is purchased through a fund or some other vehicle.\nIt can be divided among a pool of investors, and can be categorized by the way the property is used by the owners or tenants.\nCan be owned in various forms such as public, private or financed through equity of debt. \n\nForms of Real Estate Investments\n\nFree and Clear Equity - A free and clear equity investment confers full ownership for an indefinite period of time. The investor gets all ownership rights. It is an outright purchase of the asset with no encumbrances.\nLeverage Equity - Leverage equity has same ownership rights as free and clear equity but is subject to debt (promissory note) or a pledge (mortgage) to hand over those rights if payments and terms of the debt are not met.\nMortgages- Mortgages are debt investments in which the mortgage holder receives a stream of payments like a bondholder (principal and interest). Mortgage holders are a type of real estate investor because they are entitled to take possession of the real estate asset if the mortgagee defaults. Mortgages can include a clause for early prepayment, which impacts the investor's payment flows. Investors diversify their real estate portfolios by purchasing mortgages that vary in terms of region, duration of the mortgage and type of property (commercial, residential, etc.) \nAggregation Vehicles - Aggregation vehicles pool investors' funds together, giving them broader and deeper access to the real estate market. These include: \n\n\n\nReal estate limited partnerships "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_371", "text": "\nCost ApproachValues real estate based on \"what would it cost to replace the building in its current form with the value of the land added to it?\" The cost approach sounds like a straightforward and easy-to-calculate method for determining value, but it is difficult to implement. Getting an apprised value for the cost of the existing structure can be difficult in some markets. Furthermore, the market value of the existing prosperity may be very different from its construction cost.   Sale Comparison Approach This approach looks at the price at which other real estate property with similar characteristics (location, size, age, etc.) has recently been sold or valued. Most residential real estate is appraised or valued using this method. At times, this can also be a difficult method to implement: a comparable property may be hard to identify (especially if the property in question has unique features) or there may not be any sales of comparable properties in the recent past.    The Income Approach This approach uses a perpetuity discount type of model. The net income derived from the property is discounted at a market required rate of return. The appraisal value = net operating income (NOI)/market cap rate. The Market cap rate is found by benchmark NOI/benchmark transaction price. The problem with this approach is that long-term tenants may not be paying current market rates, depressing the value of the investment. An inflationary environment may also take a bite out of the value of the property.   Discounted After-Tax Cash Flow Approach Calculating the value of the discounted cash flows from a real estate investment can act as a validation or check on other valuation methods. This approach takes into account the investor's individual tax bracket, depreciation and any interest payments. See the example below.Calculate Net Operating Income from a Real Estate InvestmentThe CFA Level 1 exam requires you to know how to create an income statement for a property.

However, candidates may be asked to calculate price increases of a certain time period to evaluate the impact on NOI.\n\n\nSales Comparison Approach:Looks at the characteristics of similar properties and how they are valued:\n\n\nCharacteristic\nUnits\nValue\n\n\nNumber of rooms\nNumber\n$25,000\n\n\nNumber of bathrooms\nNumber\n$10,000\n\n\nDistance to city\nMiles\n($2,000)\n\n\n The property you want to value has eight rooms, three bathrooms and is 10 miles from the city.The value would equal (8 * $25,000) + (3 * $10,000) +(10 * -$2,000) = $200,000 + $30,000 - $20,000 = $210,000 based on similar property types.Income Approach:In this approach, the investor would estimate total real estate value based on the rate of return from the property. Therefore, any potential rents expected from a lessee for use of the property would be compared against similar property types.Calculating After-tax Cash FlowsLet's start with some basic information:NOI = $125,000Depreciation = $5,000Mortgage payment = $60,000Purchase price = $725,00075% financing at 8% interest rateNOI growth rate = 4%Marginal Tax Rate = 31%.After-tax cash flow = Amount borrowed ($725,000 * .75) = $543,750.First year's interest = ($543,750* .08)  = $43,500. After-tax income = ($125,000 - $5,000-$43,500) * (1-.31)= $52,785To arrive at after-tax cash flow from after tax income, depreciation must be added and the principal repayment of the mortgage payment must be subtracted.\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_372", "text": "\nVenture capital is a source of financing for new businesses. Venture capital funds pool investors' cash and loan it to startup firms and small businesses with perceived, long-term growth potential. This is a very important source of funding startups that do not have access to other capital and it typically entails high risk (and potentially high returns) for the investor. Most venture capital comes from groups of wealthy investors, investment banks and other financial institutions that pool such investments or partnerships. This form of raising capital is popular among new companies, or ventures, with a limited operating history that cannot raise capital though a debt issue or equity offering. Often, venture firms will also provide start-ups with managerial or technical expertise. For entrepreneurs, venture capitalists are a vital source of financing, but the cash infusion often comes at a high price. Venture firms often take large equity positions in exchange for funding and may also require representation on the start-up's board. The Stages in Venture Capital (VC) InvestingAngel investors are most often individuals (friends, relations or entrepreneurs) who want to help other entrepreneurs get their businesses off the ground - and earn a high return on their investment. The term \"angel\" comes from the practice in the early 1900s of wealthy businessmen investing in Broadway productions. Usually they are the bridge from the self-funded stage of the business to the point that the business needs true venture capital. Angel funding usually ranges from $150,000 to $1.5 million. They typically offer expertise, experience and contacts in addition to money. \n\nSeed - The first stage of venture capital financing. Seed-stage financings are often comparatively modest amounts of capital provided to inventors or entrepreneurs to finance the early development of a new product or service. These early financings may be directed toward product development, market research, building a management team and developing a business plan. A genuine seed-stage company has usually not yet established commercial operations - a cash infusion to fund continued research and product development is essential. These early companies are typically quite difficult business opportunities to finance, often requiring capital for pre-startup R&D, product development and testing, or designing specialized equipment. An initial seed investment round made by a professional VC firm typically ranges from $250,000 to $1 million. Seed-stage VC funds will typically participate in later investment rounds with other equity players to finance business expansion costs such as sales and distribution, parts and inventory, hiring, training and marketing. \nEarly Stage - For companies that are able to begin operations but are not yet at the stage of commercial manufacturing and sales, early stage financing supports a step-up in capabilities. At this point, new business can consume vast amounts of cash, while VC firms with a large number of early-stage companies in their portfolios can see costs quickly escalate. \n\nStart-up - Supports product development and initial marketing. Start-up financing provides funds to companies for product development and initial marketing. This type of financing is usually provided to companies just organized or to those that have been in business just a short time but have not yet sold their product in the marketplace. Generally, such firms have already assembled key management, prepared a business plan and made market studies. At this stage, the business is seeing its first revenues but has yet to show a profit. This is often where the enterprise brings in its first \"outside\" investors.\nFirst Stage - Capital is provided to initiate commercial manufacturing and sales. Most first-stage companies have been in business less than three years and have a product or service in testing or pilot production. In some cases, the product may be commercially available. \n\nFormative Stage - Financing includes seed stage and early stage.\nLater Stage - Capital provided after commercial manufacturing and sales but before any initial public offering. The product or service is in production and is commercially available. The company demonstrates significant revenue growth, but may or may not be showing a profit. It has usually been in business for more than three years.\n\nThird Stage - Capital provided for major expansion such as physical plant expansion, product improvement and marketing.\nExpansion Stage - Financing refers to the second and third stages.\nMezzanine (bridge) - Finances the step of going public and represents the bridge between expanding the company and the IPO\n\nBalanced-stage financing refers to all the stages, seed through mezzanine. \n\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_373", "text": "\n\u00a0\nIlliquid - No easy or short-term path to get out of the investment. An investor will most likely have to wait until the company is able to attract a buy-out or issue an IPO. A liquidity risk premium is a characteristic of the initial investment.\nLong-term commitment required - Given the nature of the investment and the process of developing a viable business, VC investors must make a long-term commitment - at least three to five years; however, the profit potential is huge. This is mostly due to the time lag between starting a company and bringing it to a buy-out or IPO. \nDifficulty determining market values - Since these assets do not trade in an active marketplace it's difficult to determine an objective value for the business and the investment. \nLimited historical risk and return data - This is due to the fact that there are no active trading markets.\nEntrepreneurial/management mismatches - Brilliant entrepreneurs don't always make the best business executives. Management styles that may have worked perfectly during a business's early stages may be disastrous as the company grows larger. \nFund manager incentive mismatches - Managers may be rewarded for the size of their fund, not its performance.\nLack of knowledge of the competitors - Because some entrepreneurs are developing new businesses, there is generally little information as to who else is working in their space. As such, competitive valuations are difficult to find in the marketplace.\nVintage cycles - The volume of business start-ups is dependent on the economic climate - some years offer more and better opportunities than others. It all depends on the market and who and when firms are entering and exiting the marketplace.\nExtensive operations analysis and advice may be required - Most often, the start-up's founder and early manager has a specific type of business experience - say, financial expertise - but may lack operational or marketing experience. \n\nCalculating the net present value of a venture capital project\nLet's illustrate this with an example:\nAn investor can invest $2 million in a new project that will last five years and will pay $18 million. His cost of equity for this project is 14%. He also knows that the project could fail at any time and has given the following percentages for the failure rate as follows:\nYear 1: 35%, Year 2: 30%, Year 3: 25%, Year 4: 20%, Year 5: 20%\nAnswer\n1) The first step is to determine the probability that the project will work. This equals (1-.35)(1-.30)(1-.25)(1-.20)(1-.20)= .65 x .70 x .75 x .80 x .80=. 22 or a 22% chance of success.\nNow if the project fails, the NPV = -$2,000,000 (the amount invested in the project); however, if it works out the NPV of the project if it survives five years = 18,000,000 \u00f7 (1.14^5) = $9,348,637.\nSo the expected NPV = (.22 x 9,348,637) + (.78 x -2,000,000) = 2,056,700 - 1,560,000 = 496,700.\nBased on these calculations, an investor would take this investment because of the positive expected NPV.\n\u00a0\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_374", "text": "\nIf you're new to the concept of hedge funds, we recommend a read of the following two articles. Introduction to Hedge Funds -Part 1 discusses everything you need to know about the characteristics and strategies of hedge funds, while Introduction to Hedge Funds - Part 2 discusses the advantages and pitfalls of hedge funds and what factors should be considered before choosing one.\nWhat is a Hedge Fund?\n\"Hedge fund\" is a general, non-legal term that was originally used to describe a type of private and unregistered investment pool that employed sophisticated hedging and arbitrage techniques to trade in the corporate equity markets. Hedge funds have traditionally been limited to sophisticated, wealthy investors. In earlier markets, the term \"hedge fund\" referred to an asset class employing a strategy to offset its market risk exposure by taking an opposing position - for example, selling short or holding futures. In fact, a perfect hedge is one that totally offsets gains and losses, creating a position that is completely neutral. In today's markets, a hedge fund can be just about anything. They may or may not use leverage, make bets on a global basis or look at the technical aspects of a security in an attempt to find a mispricing in the marketplace. Over time, the activities of hedge funds broadened into other financial instruments and activities. Today, the term \"hedge fund\" refers not so much to hedging techniques, which hedge funds may or may not employ, as it does to their status as private and unregistered investment pools. \nHedge funds are similar to mutual funds in that they both are pooled investment vehicles that accept investors' money and invest it on a collective basis. Hedge funds differ significantly from mutual funds, however, because hedge funds are not required to register under the federal securities laws. That's because they generally only accept financially sophisticated, high-net-worth investors. Some funds are limited to no more than 100 investors. \nFreed from regulation, hedge funds engage in leverage and other sophisticated investment techniques to a much greater extent than mutual funds (although they are subject to the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws). \n\u00a0\nDirect Hedge: This is accomplished by hedging one asset, such as common stock, with another asset that shares similar price movements and trades in a similar fashion. An example of this would be hedging a common stock position with call options. \nCross Hedge: This involves hedging an instrument with an unlike instrument. An example of a strategy that failed in the crash of 1987 will exemplify the concept. This involved buying (long) preferred stocks and hedging the position with Treasury futures. Interest rates drive Treasury futures, and there are times when these two instruments track one another - about 85% of the time. In the 1987 scenario, the value of the preferred stock fell and the Treasury futures rose. Because this strategy involved shorting the futures, it proved unsuccessful on both sides. \nDynamic Hedge: Involves changing the amount of puts in a position over time, according to the market environment. This can protect against the downside risk associated with a long position. Options traders ordinarily hedge options by shorting a dynamic replicating portfolio against a long position in the option to eliminate all the risk related to stock price movement. It's essentially a technique of portfolio insurance or position risk management and includes any hedging that is done on an active and changing basis, not necessarily using options, although in most cases options are involved. \nStatic Hedge: This also strives to eliminate risk. Given some particular target option, a static hedge is constructed so that it will not require any further adjustment and will exactly replicate the value of the target option. This is referred to as a static replicating portfolio. It's a fixed and unchanging hedge that is set until maturity. \n\nHedge Fund Objectives\nOne thing all hedge funds have in common is their search for addition alpha or absolute returns. This is the objective of a hedge fund: absolute returns and making money for investors. This will be accomplished by using whatever type of market strategies the hedge fund believes will give it an advantage.\nLegal Structure of a Hedge Fund\nHedge funds generally rely on Sections 3(c)(1) and 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 to avoid registration and regulation as investment companies. Hedge fund legal structure is typically in the form of a limited partnership, as a limited liability corporation in the U.S., or as an offshore corporation. These structures provide the freedom that hedge fund managers need to operate without restrictions.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFunds are limited to 1,009 partners who must be \"accredited investors\" and the fund may not advertise. \nSome funds are structured under section 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act and are exempt form most SEC regulations. \nThe minimum investment is typically $200,000 but that is beginning to change to the lower side of that number.\n\nFee Structure of a Hedge Fund\nFees are the lifeblood of a hedge fund. The manager usually gets a base management fee based on the value of the assets in the fund, such as 1% of the fund's assets. Managers also receive an incentive fee based on their performance that typically ranges between 15-30%. This fee typically occurs after the fund has reached the target return for investors. For any profit generated after that mark, the fund would receive the 15-30%.\n\u00a0\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_375", "text": "\n\n\nLong/Short - This is the traditional type of hedge fund. Its strategy involves buying certain stocks long and selling others short. There usually isn't a restriction on the country in which the stocks must be traded. Long/short funds use leverage and adjust \"net\" long or short positions based on economic forecasting.\nMarket-neutral funds - A hedge fund strategy that seeks to exploit differences in stock prices by being long and short in stocks within the same sector, industry, market capitalization, country, etc. This strategy creates a hedge against market factors. Long positions are viewed as undervalued while short are overvalued. These funds tend to use leverage.This is the ultimate strategy for stock pickers because stock picking is all that counts. For example, a hedge fund manager will go long in the 10 biotech stocks that should outperform and short the 10 biotech stocks that will underperform. Therefore, what the actual market does won't matter (much) because the gains and losses will offset each other. If the sector moves in one direction or the other, a gain on the long stock is offset by a loss on the short.\nGlobal macro fund - A hedge fund strategy that bases its holdings - such as long and short positions in various equity, fixed income, currency and futures markets - primarily on overall economic and political views of various countries (macroeconomic principles). For example, if a manager believes that the U.S. is headed into recession, he or she might short sell stocks and futures contracts on major U.S. indexes or the U.S. dollar. Or, a manager who sees a big opportunity for growth in Singapore might take long positions in Singapore's assets.\nFutures fund (managed future fund) - Commodity pools that include commodity trading advisor funds (CTA). These funds take direction bets in the positions they hold in a single asset class such as currencies and interest rates or commodities.\nEmerging-market fund - A mutual fund that invests a majority of its assets in the financial markets of a developing country, typically a small market with a short operating history. These markets tend to be less liquid and efficient than developed markets. They are fairly volatile and are influenced by economic and political factors.\nEvent Driven - A hedge fund strategy in which the manager takes significant positions in a certain number of companies in \"special situations.\" This includes:\n\nDistressed securities funds - Invest in debt or equity of companies with severe problems and that are in or close to bankruptcy. The fund manager takes a long position in such companies when he believes that the company can turn around its situation and achieve profitability. He takes a short position if he believes the company will ultimately fail. \nRisk arbitrage in mergers and acquisitions - The technique takes advantage of price differences that usually exist between the current market price of the shares of a company that is being acquired and the stock price of the acquiring company. The company being taken over will tend to trade up in price while the company acquiring the other firm will tend to decrease in value. The risk is that the merger will fail and each stock will revert back it its original level. \n\n\n\nDistressed Securities InvestingDistressed securities are stocks, bonds and trade or financial claims of companies in, or about to enter or exit, bankruptcy or financial distress or that are seeking to restructure themselves outside of court. Perhaps a company over-expanded or it is in debt as a result of a lawsuit or natural disaster, or it's experiencing management problems. In these situations, the prices of the company's securities falls in anticipation of the financial distress when its holders choose to sell rather than remain invested in a financially troubled company. Investment professionals, who understand the true risks and values of a company and can do detailed research, may be able to buy these securities or claims at discounted prices, from current owners who have overlooked or ignore the company's true worth. Investing in distressed securities requires extensive legal, operational and financial analysis as well as an understanding that the bondholders have a superior claim on the company's assets. In fact, distressed investing usually takes place in the buying of the distressed company's debt securities.A distressed opportunity typically arises when a company, unable to meet all of its debts, files for Chapter 11 (reorganization) or Chapter 7 (liquidation) bankruptcy. If a company files for Chapter 7, a company will cease operations and parcel out its assets to its creditors. Chapter 11 gives the company legal protection to continue operating while working out a repayment plan, known as a plan for reorganization, with its major creditors, including bondholders, banks, utilities and major vendors. When a company's assets are not sufficient to repay all claims, the stockholders (the last of the stakeholders to be paid) are unlikely to get any of the proceeds from the liquidation or reorganization.  Therefore, investors in distressed securities focus mostly on acquiring the company's bonds, bank debt or even trade claims.   Companies in critical situations are motivated to sell to distressed securities investors because traditional institutional investors, like pension funds, are barred from holding below investment-grade bonds ('BBB' or lower). Banks are eager to sell their bad loans in order to remove them from their books and vendors or other holders of trade claims have no expertise or interest in assessing the likelihood of getting paid once a company has filed for Chapter 11. In short, when companies get into financial trouble, there is usually the opportunity to buy at steep discounts from people to whom money is owed. This type of investing is similar to venture capital because both types of investing are performed with the hopes that the company will eventually turn a profit. In both scenarios, investors work with company management to reach the desired result.\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_376", "text": "\nAlthough leverage is used in many hedge fund strategies, some do not use it at all. Funds can increase their leverage in three ways:\n\nBorrow external funds to invest more or sell short more than the equity capital they put in\nBorrow through a margin account\nUse financial instruments and derivatives that require posting margins (and a smaller cash outlay) rather than purchasing the underlying securities.  \n\nLeverage can run anywhere from 2:1 ratio up to as high as 500:1 with arbitrage strategies using the most leverage because the trading profits are so narrow.The unique risks include:\n\nLiquidity risk - Occurs in very thin or illiquid securities. In extreme market conditions, liquidity problems can cause the collapse of the entire fund.\nPricing risk - Some of the assets in which a hedge fund invests can be very complicated, making it very difficult to price the securities properly.\nCounterparty risk - Hedge funds tend to deal with broker/dealers. As such, there is always the risk that a particular broker/dealer may fail or simply cut off the hedge fund. In these situations, the downside risk for the hedge fund and all its participants is extremely serious.\nSettlement risk - Failure to deliver the securities by one or more parties to the transaction.\nShort Squeeze risk - A short squeeze occurs when you have to purchase the securities you sold short before you want to. This can occur because the investors from whom you borrowed the security need it earlier than anticipated. \nFinancial squeeze - Occurs when companies find themselves unable to borrow or unable to borrow at acceptable rates. Overextended credit lines, defaults and other debt issues can cause a financial squeeze. Margin calls and mark to market positions may also result in financial issues. \n\nHedge Fund PerformanceFor some hedge funds, the ability to find their returns can be difficult because of the nature of the industry. However, studies have presented strong cases for investing in hedge funds biased on the following:\n\nThey tend to have a net return that is higher than equity and bond markets.\nThey tend to have lower risks than equities when measured by the volatility of their returns.\nSharpe ratios tend to be higher than those of equities and bonds. The Sharpe ratio is the reward to risk measured as the mean return in excess of the risk-free rate divided by the standard deviation.\nCorrelation of hedge funds with conventional investment is generally low but still positive. \n\nSurvivorship bias is an important issue that needs to be addressed when analyzing past performance of funds. In brief, survivorship bias results from the tendency for poor performers to drop out while strong performers continue to exist. In other words, unsuccessful funds are taken out of the performance presentations and only the ones that have performed well are included. Therefore, when analyzing past performance of funds, the sample of current funds will include those that have been successful in the past, while many funds that previously existed but underperformed and were closed or merged are not included. Performance returns can be misleading because they are based on only the funds that have survived and not the ones that died. Researchers have demonstrated in recent years that survivorship bias can play a significant role in biasing past returns of individual securities, mutual funds and even equities of specific countries. This is of particular importance when looking at hedge funds because they often do not have to comply with performance presentation standards. Survivorship bias results in an overestimation of past returns and leads investors to be overly optimistic in predictions of future returns. Survivorship bias causes the results of some studies to skew higher because only companies that were successful enough to survive until the end of the period are included. Similarly, mutual fund performance may be misleading due to survivorship bias if the fund family tends to merge or discontinue underperforming fundsA technique that some companies use in launching new products is to \"incubate\" funds. For example, a company wishing to launch a new series of mutual funds might provide ten managers with a small amount of seed money to start aggressive funds. Each manager is given two years to test his or her stock picking ability. At the end of the period, several of the funds are likely to have outperformed the market. Those successful funds are then made available to the public and marketed aggressively while the losers are silently discontinued. This is what is known as \"creation bias\".Once you have an appreciation for the effects of survivorship and creation bias it's easy to see how companies can effectively guarantee long-term records of superior performance. By starting with a large number of funds and discontinuing or merging the poor performers, a company is left with just the cream of the crop. \n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_377", "text": "\nAny fund that pools capital and uses two or more sub managers to invest that capital - whether it is debt, equity, commodities, derivatives, or currencies, is a fund of funds. Any combination of the above instruments may be used depending on the objectives of the fund. Because of the loose definition of this term, a pension fund or an endowment fund can be considered a fund of funds. But for clarity, we'll concentrate on a fund of funds as it relates to other hedge funds. By its very nature, a fund of funds does not make direct investments, and it is known as a \"look through\" vehicle. The fund of funds manager spends considerable time evaluating and identifying strategies and selecting the hedge funds to implement them. Depending on the expertise of the fund of funds manager, this can yield superior investment results. Ordinarily, a fund of funds is structured as a limited partnership. Benefits:\n\nRetailing - Allows an investor access to a large number of hedge funds.\nAccess - May be able to allow investors into funds that are already closed to new investors if the fund of fund already has cash placed with a particular manager.\nDiversification - Allows investors to diversify the risk of a single hedge fund by investing in several types of hedge funds. A fund of funds can control risk by achieving manager diversity. They accomplish this by diversifying in the strategies those managers employ. To the investor, this allows them to participate in a unique asset allocation mechanism while hopefully limiting downside risk.\nExpertise - Managers should have better knowledge and experience in picking successful hedge fund managers.\nDue Diligence Process -This process is very time consuming and highly specialized. A fund of funds manager should be exceptionally experienced and well equipped to perform this process. \n\nFund of funds are not without disadvantages, however, and we would be remiss not to discuss them. Drawbacks:\n\nFee - An investor in a fund of funds is required to pay an additional layer of fees. Usually, these fees range from 1-2% of assets, but some fund of funds charge a performance fee, too. However, the SEC limits the number of fees an investor can pay. \nPerformance - The hedge funds in the fund of funds are usually chosen by their past performance, which tends to give little indication of future performance. It is wise to remember that a fund of funds is only as good as its manager and the underlying funds it invests in. \nDiversification is a two-edged sword - Blending various types of hedge funds may reduce your exposure; however, you'll be subject to higher fees and disparate returns. \n\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_378", "text": "\nAlternative investment products are generally run by firms whose ownership is controlled by only a handful of owners. However, while most closely-held companies are small, non-public firms, some large publicly-traded companies fall into this category if their stock is held by only a few institutional owners. Closely-held companies can be organized in various forms such as general or limited partnership, sole proprietorship, regular corporation etc. The legal environment in which a closely-held company operates impacts the valuation of that company. Prevailing state laws, for example, define company ownership, voting power and other issues of control. Furthermore, asset valuation may depend on interpretations specific to the company's legal jurisdiction. Alternative Valuation Methods for Closely Held Companies\n\nCost Approach - The cost approach determines what it would cost to replace all the company's assets in their present form and condition. \nComparables Approach - Market values are estimated via some benchmark. The benchmark may be a similar corporation that is publicly-traded or has recently sold. The benchmark needs to be constantly updated to reflect market changes.\nIncome Approach - Uses a discounted income or cash flow model. Any anticipated future economic income flows are discounted at an appropriate rate.\n\nAfter valuing the firm, a number of discounts or premiums are applied to the preliminary value.\nDiscounts usually are taken for the illiquidity. Since the stock of closely-held or private corporations does not trade on public markets and may be difficult to sell, a significant discount is applied.  \nA discount may also apply if one is only acquiring a minority interest and will have little influence in how the business is run.\nAlternatively, a premium may be paid for acquiring controlling interest.  \n\n\n\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_379", "text": "\nCommodities are raw materials that are sold in bulk, such as oil, wheat, silver, gold, pork bellies, oranges and cocoa. They are generally raw materials that are eventually used to produce other goods such as oil for gasoline, cocoa for chocolate, wheat for bread, etc. As such, they give an investor the opportunity to invest in the materials that a country (or corporation) produces as well as those that it consumes. Most larger manufacturers buy the commodities they need on the \"spot market,\" where the full cash price is usually paid on the spot. Speculators typically buy and sell commodities with options and futures contracts.Types of Commodity InvestmentsA commodity-linked security refers to a security whose return is dependent to a certain extent on the price level of a commodity, such as crude oil, gold, or silver, at maturity. For example, the principal of a commodity-linked bond is indexed to movements of a commodity index such as precious metal or oil. Commodity derivatives include both exchange-traded and over-the-counter commodity derivatives such as swaps, futures and forwards. They are used to hedge risk and to take advantage of arbitrage opportunities.Collateralized Commodity Futurespositions involve taking a long position in the futures contract of your choice and then purchasing the amount equal to your futures position in T-bills. The source of return comes from the interest you earn on your T-bill position and the movement of the futures price.Motivations for Investing in Commodities, Commodity Derivatives, and Commodity-linked SecuritiesCommodities offer investors a number of benefits: \n\nHedge Against Inflation: Commodity cash prices may benefit from periods of unexpected inflation, whereas stocks and bonds may suffer. Commodities are \"real assets\", unlike stocks and bonds, which are \"financial assets\". Commodities, therefore, tend to react to changing economic fundamentals in ways that are different from traditional financial assets, particularly with respect to inflation. Commodity prices usually rise when inflation is accelerating, so investing in commodities can give portfolios a hedge against inflation. Conversely, stocks and bonds tend to perform better when the rate of inflation is stable or slowing. Faster inflation lowers the value of future cash flows paid by stocks and bonds because those future dollars will be able to buy fewer goods and services than they would today.However, this inflation advantage is captured more efficiently by direct investment in commodities than, for example, investment in commodity-related equities whose prices also reflect the financial prospects of the issuer or actively managed commodity futures accounts, which tend to reflect the manager's skills at selecting the right commodities.  \nPerformance/Return: Investor interest in commodities has soared in recent years as the asset class has outperformed traditional assets such as stocks and bonds. Over the five-year period ended March 31, 2006, the Dow Jones AIG Commodity Index has returned 10.6%, versus 2.6% for the S&P 500. Part of this superior performance is attributable to a rise in commodity prices driven by increased demand from China and other emerging countries.\nEnhanced Diversification: Portfolio diversification is the primary benefit of holding commodities. The reason for that is the commodity investor is exposed to commodity futures prices. Changes in those prices reflect changing expectations about future supply and demand for commodities. Factors that change expectations - such as a weather event in the Midwest or a strike in a copper mine in Chile - typically don't have anything to do with stock and bond markets. \n\nForms of Commodity InvestingInvesting in commodities comes in two forms: passive and active:\n\nPassive investing is a strategy used by investors who are using commodities as a risk diversification tool. For example, when inflation picks up, it tends to hurt fixed income securities and equities to some extent. However, prices of commodities tend to rise during these periods. This helps diversify your portfolio. Commodity investing has long had a reputation for exceptional volatility and risk but there is now a small but growing number of excellent, high-quality index-based commodity funds available that provide a relatively conservative way to invest in commodities. The management attempts to minimize price fluctuations and provide overall risk management in several ways. The selection and weighting of assets in a portfolio are typically reviewed annually or when there is a major change in an industry or even a drastic change in usage of any given commodity. This provides some overall risk reduction in commodity index funds and makes them suitable for investment by investors with limited commodity backgrounds.Index funds usually consist of long positions on the contracts. Short positions are usually not taken. \nActive investing or actively managing a position in the commodities market can provide good performance results. In periods of economic growth, commodities are in strong demand to satisfy production needs. Because commodity or raw material prices tend to move more quickly in reaction to economic fluctuations than do the prices of the related finished goods, an active approach could lead to economic gains if trading activities are closely monitored and managed by the investor. \n\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_380", "text": "\nThe following section focuses on topics related to the management of a client's portfolio.

As such, an investor would set his return above his required rate of return to diminish the risk that his required rate of return will not be met. The excess return above the investor's required rate of return is known as the risk premium.

As such, it is important to monitor for these changes as they occur and to update the plan toadjust for the changes that have occurred. \n\nPolicy StatementA policy statement is the statement that contains the investor's goals and constraints as it relates to his investments. This could be considered to be the most important of all the steps in the portfolio management process. The statement requires the investor to consider his true financial needs, both in the short run and the long run. It helps to guide the investment portfolio manager in meeting the investor's needs. When there is market uncertainty or the investor's needs change, the policy statement will help to guide the investor in making the necessary adjustments the portfolio in a disciplined manner.Expressing Investment Objectives in Terms of Risk and ReturnReturn objectives are important to determine. They help to focus an investor on meeting his financial goals and objectives. However, risk must be considered as well. An investor may require a high rate of return. A high rate of return is typically accompanied by a higher risk. Despite the need for a high return, an investor may be uncomfortable with the risk that is attached to that higher return portfolio. As such, it is important to consider not only return, but the risk of the investor in a policy statement.Factors Affecting Risk ToleranceAn investor's risk tolerance can be affected by many factors: \n\nAge- an investor may have lower risk tolerance as they get older and financial constraints are more prevalent.\nFamily situation - an investor may have higher income needs if they are supporting a child in college or an elderly relative.\nWealth and income - an investor may have a greater ability to invest in a portfolio if he or she has existing wealth or high income.\nPsychological - an investor may simply have a lower tolerance for risk based on his personality. \n\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_385", "text": "\nReturn objectives can be divided into the following needs: \n\nCapital Preservation - Capital preservation is the need to maintain capital. To accomplish this objective, the return objective should, at a minimum, be equal to the inflation rate. In other words, nominal rate of return would equal the inflation rate. With this objective, an investor simply wants to preserve his existing capital. \n\n\nCapital Appreciation -Capital appreciation is the need to grow, rather than simply preserve, capital. To accomplish this objective, the return objective should be equal to a return that exceeds the expected inflation. With this objective, an investor's intention is to grow his existing capital base.\nCurrent Income -Current income is the need to create income from the investor's capital base. With this objective, an investor needs to generate income from his investments. This is frequently seen with retired investors who no longer have income from work and need to generate income off of their investments to meet living expenses and other spending needs. \n\n\nTotal Return - Total return is the need to grow the capital base through both capital appreciation and reinvestment of that appreciation.  \n\nInvestment ConstraintsWhen creating a policy statement, it is important to consider an investor's constraints. There are five types of constraints that need to be considered when creating a policy statement. They are as follows:\n\nLiquidity Constraints - Liquidity constraints identify an investor's need for liquidity, or cash. For example, within the next year, an investor needs $50,000 for the purchase of a new home. The $50,000 would be considered a liquidity constraint because it needs to be set aside (be liquid) for the investor.\nTime Horizon - A time horizon constraint develops a timeline of an investor's various financial  needs. The time horizon also affects an investor's ability to accept risk. If an investor has a long time horizon, the investor may have a greater ability to accept risk because he would have a longer time period to recoup any losses. This is unlike an investor with a shorter time horizon whose ability to accept risk may be lower because he would not have the ability to recoup any losses.\nTax Concerns - After-tax returns are the returns investors are focused on when creating an investment portfolio. If an investor is currently in a high tax bracket as a result of his income, it may be important to focus on investments that would not make the investor's situation worse, like investing more heavily in tax-deferred  investments. \n\n\nLegal and Regulatory - Legal and regulatory factors can act as an investment constraint and must be considered. An example of this would occur in a trust. A trust could require that no more than 10% of the trust be distributed each year. Legal and regulatoryconstraints such as this one often can't be changed and must not be overlooked. \n\n\nUnique Circumstances - Any special needs or constraints not recognized in any of the constraints listed above would fall in this category. An example of a unique circumstance would be the constraint an investor might place on investing in any company that is not socially responsible, such as a tobacco company.  \n\nThe Importance of Asset AllocationAsset Allocation is the process of dividing a portfolio among major asset categories such as bonds, stocks or cash. The purpose of asset allocation is to reduce risk by diversifying the portfolio. The ideal asset allocation differs based on the risk tolerance of the investor. For example, a young executive might have an asset allocation of 80% equity, 20% fixed income, while a retiree would be more likely to have 80% in fixed income and 20% equities.Citizens in other countries around the world would have different asset allocation strategies depending on the types and risks of securities available for placement in their portfolio. For example, a retiree located in the United States would most likely have a large portion of his portfolio allocated to U.S. treasuries, since the U.S. Government is considered to have an extremely low risk of default. On the other hand, a retiree in a country with political unrest would most likely have a large portion of their portfolio allocated to foreign treasury securities, such as that of the U.S.\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_386", "text": "\nRisk Aversion Risk aversion is an investor's general desire to avoid participation in \"risky\" behavior or, in this case, risky investments. Investors typically wish to maximize their return with the least amount of risk possible. When faced with two investment opportunities with similar returns, good investor will always choose the investment with the least risk as there is no benefit to choosing a higher level of risk unless there is also an increased level of return. Insurance is a great example of investors' risk aversion. Given the potential for a car accident, an investor would rather pay for insurance and minimize the risk of a huge outlay in the event of an accident.Markowitz Portfolio TheoryHarry Markowitz developed the portfolio model. This model includes not only expected return, but also includes the level of risk for a particular return. Markowitz assumed the following about an individual's investment behavior: \n\nGiven the same level of expected return, an investor will choose the investment with the lowest amount of risk.\nInvestors measure risk in terms of an investment's variance or standard deviation.\nFor each investment, the investor can quantify the investment's expected return and the probability of those returns over a specified time horizon.\nInvestors seek to maximize their utility. \nInvestors make decision based on an investment's risk and return, therefore, an investor's utility curve is based on risk and return. \n\nThe Efficient FrontierMarkowitz' work on an individual's investment behavior is important not only when looking at individual investment, but also in the context of a portfolio. The risk of a portfolio takes into account each investment's risk and return as well as the investment's correlation with the other investments in the portfolio.\n\n\nLook Out!Risk of a portfolio is affected by the risk of each investment in the portfolio relative to its return, as well as each investment\\'s correlation with the other investments in the portfolio.\n\n\nA portfolio is considered efficient if it gives the investor a higher expected return with the same or lower level of risk as compared to another investment. The efficient frontieris simply a plot of those efficient portfolios, as illustrated below.Figure 17.2: Efficient Frontier\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile an efficient frontier illustrates each of the efficient portfolios relative to risk and return levels, each of the efficient portfolios may not be appropriate for every investor. Recall that when creating an investment policy, return and risk were the key objectives. An investor's risk profile is illustrated with indifference curves. The optimal portfolio, then, is the point on the efficient frontier that is tangential to the investor's highest indifference curve. See our article: A Guide to Portfolio Construction, for some essential steps when taking a systematic approach to constructing a portfolio.\n\n\nLook Out!The optimal portfolio for a risk-averse investor will not be as risky as the optimal portfolio of an investor who is willing to accept more risk. \n\n\n\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_387", "text": "\nIndividual InvestmentThe expected return for an individual investment is simply the sum of the probabilities of the possible expected returns for the investment.\n\nFormula 17.3\n\t\t\tExpected Return E(R) = p1R1 + p2R2 + .....+ pnRn\n\t\t\tWhere:  pn = the probability the return actually will occur in state n\n\t\t\tRn  = the expected return for state n\n\nExample:\nFor Newco's stock, assume the following potential returns. \nFigure 3.3: Expected returns for Newco's stock price in the various states\n\u00a0\nScenario\nProbability\nExpected Return\nWorst Case\n10%\n10%\nBase Case\n80%\n14%\nBest Case\n10%\n18%\nGiven the above assumptions, determine the expected return for Newco's stock.\nAnswer:\nE(R) = (0.10)(10%) + (0.80)(14%) + (0.10)(18%) \nE(R) = 14.0%\nThe expected return for Newco's stock is 14%.\n\u00a0\nPortfolio\nTo determine the expected return on a portfolio, the weighted average expected return of the assets that comprise the portfolio is taken.\n\nFormula 17.4\n\t\t\tE(R) of a portfolio = w1R1 + w2Rq + ...+ wnRn\n\nExample:\nAssume an investment manager has created a portfolio with the Stock A and Stock B.

The main assumptions of the capital market theory are as follows:\n\nAll Investors are Efficient Investors - Investors follow Markowitz idea of the efficient frontier and choose to invest in portfolios along the frontier.\nInvestors Borrow/Lend Money at the Risk-Free Rate - This rate remains static for any amount of money.\nThe Time Horizon is equal for All Investors - When choosing investments, investors have equal time horizons for the choseninvestments.\nAll Assets are Infinitely Divisible - This indicates that fractional shares can be purchased and the stocks can be infinitely divisible.\nNo Taxes and Transaction Costs -assume that investors' results are not affected by taxes and transaction costs. \nAll Investors Have the Same Probability for Outcomes -When determining the expected return, assume that all investors have the same probability for outcomes.\nNo Inflation Exists - Returns are not affected by the inflation rate in a capital market as none exists in capital market theory. \nThere is No Mispricing Within the Capital Markets - Assume the markets are efficient and that no mispricings within the markets  exist. \n\nWhat happens when a risk-free asset is added to a portfolio of risky assets?To begin, the risk-free asset has a standard deviation/variance equal to zero for its given level of return, hence the \"risk-free\" label.\n\nExpected Return - When the Risk-Free Asset is AddedGiven its lower level of return and its lower level of risk, adding the risk-free asset to a portfolio acts to reduce the overall return of the portfolio. Example: Risk-Free Asset and Expected ReturnAssume an investor's portfolio consists entirely of risky assets with an expected return of 16% and a standard deviation of 0.10. The investor would like to reduce the level of risk in the portfolio and decides to transfer 10% of his existing portfolio into the risk-free rate with an expected return of 4%. What is the expected return of the new portfolio and how was the portfolio's expected return affected given the addition of the risk-free asset?Answer:The expected return of the new portfolio is: (0.9)(16%) + (0.1)(4%) = 14.4%With the addition of the risk-free asset, the expected value of the investor's portfolio was decreased to 14.4% from 16%.\nStandard Deviation - When the Risk-Free Asset is AddedAs we have seen, the addition of the risk-free asset to the portfolio of risky assets reduces an investor's expected return. Given there is no risk with a risk-free asset, the standard deviation of a portfolio is altered when a risk-free asset is added. Example: Risk-free Asset and Standard DeviationAssume an investor's portfolio consists entirely of risky assets with an expected return of 16% and a standard deviation of 0.10. The investor would like to reduce the level of risk in the portfolio and decides to transfer 10% of his existing portfolio into the risk-free rate with an expected return of 4%. What is the standard deviation of the new portfolio and how was the portfolio's standard deviation affected given the addition of the risk-free asset?Answer:The standard deviation equation for a portfolio of two assets is rather long, however, given the standard deviation of the risk-free asset is zero, the equation is simplified quite nicely. The standard deviation of the two-asset portfolio with a risky asset is the weight of the risky assets in the portfolio multiplied by the standard deviation of the portfolio.Standard deviation of the portfolio is: (0.9)(0.1) = 0.09Similar to the affect the risk-free asset had on the expected return, the risk-free asset also has the affect of reducing standard deviation, risk, in the portfolio. \n\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_389", "text": "\nAs seen previously, adjusting for the risk of an asset using the risk-free rate, an investor can easily alter his risk profile. Keeping that in mind, in the context of the capital market line (CML), the market portfolio consists of the combination of all risky assets and the risk-free asset, using market value of the assets to determine the weights. The CML line is derived by the CAPM, solving for expected return at various levels of risk.Markowitz' idea of the efficient frontier, however, did not take into account the risk-free asset. The CML does and, as such, the frontier is extended to the risk-free rate as illustrated below:\n\n\n\n\n\nSystematic and Unsystematic RiskTotal risk to a stock not only is a function of the risk inherent within the stock itself, but is also a function of the risk in the overall market. Systematic risk is the risk associated with the market. When analyzing the risk of an investment, the systematic risk is the risk that cannot be diversified away.Unsystematic riskis the risk inherent to a stock. This risk is the aspect of total risk that can be diversified away when building a portfolio.\n\n\nFormula 17.10   Total risk = Systematic risk + Unsystematic risk\n\n\nWhen building a portfolio, a key concept is to gain the greatest return with the least amount of risk. However, it is important to note, that additional return is not guaranteed for an increased level of risk. With risk, reward can come, but losses can be magnified as well.\n\n\n    "}, {"id": "Investopedia_CFA_390", "text": "\n        The capital asset pricing model (CAPM) is a model that calculates expected return based on expected rate of return on the market, the risk-free rate and the beta coefficient of the stock.\n\n\nFormula 17.11E(R) = Rf + \u00df( Rmarket - Rf )\n\n\n\nExample: CAPM modelDetermine the expected return on Newco's stock using the capital asset pricing model.

However, the level of risk used is the Beta, the slope of the SML. The SML is illustrated below:\n\n\n\n\n\nBetaBeta is the measure of a stock's sensitivity of returns to changes in the market. It is a measure of systematic risk.\n\n\nFormula 17.12\nBeta = B = Covariance of stock to the market              Variance of the market\n\n\n\nExample: BetaAssume the covariance between Newco's stock and the market is 0.001 and the variance of the market is 0.0008. What is the beta of Newco's stock?Answer:BNewco = 0.001/0.0008 = 1.25 Newco's beta is 1.25.Determing Whether a Security is Under-, Over- or Properly ValuedAs discussed, the SML line can be derived using CAPM, solving for the expected return using beta as the measure of risk. Given that interpretation and a beta value for a specific security, we can then determine the expected return of the security with the CAPM. Then, using the expected return for a security derived from the CAPM, an investor can determine whether a security is undervalued, overvalued or properly valued.\nExample:Calculate the expected return on a security and evaluate whether the security is undervalued, overvalued or properly valued.An investor anticipates Newco's security will reach $30 by the end of one year. Newco's beta is 1.3. Assume the return on the market is expected to be 16% and the risk-free rate is 4%. Calculate the expected return of Newco's stock in one year and determine whether the stock is undervalued, overvalued or properly valued with a current value of $25.Answer:E(R)Newco = 4% + 1.3(16% - 4%) = 20%Given the expected return of Newco's stock using CAPM is 20% and the investor anticipates a 20% return, the security would be properly valued.\n\nIf the expected return using the CAPM is higher than the investor's required return, the security is undervalued and the investor should buy it.\nIf the expected return using the CAPM is lower than the investor's required return, the security is overvalued and should be sold. \n\nThe Characteristic LineThe characteristic line is line that occurs when an individual asset or portfolio is regressed to the market. The beta is the slope coefficient for the characteristic line and is thus the measure of systematic risk for the asset or portfolio. Recall, a beta is the measure of a stock's sensitivity of returns to changes in the market. It is a measure of systematic risk.\n\n\n   "}]}
